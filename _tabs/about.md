## Why did I create this site?

- I created this site to share information about topics that interest me, for
  example, Neovim, Linux, Obsidian, Docker, Kubernetes, networking, macOS
  productivity tools, etc. Its purpose is to share knowledge that I've found
  useful across the years, and also accept other points of view/suggestions from
  people in the same path, I'm always interested in learning other ways if I can
  optimize my processes.
- I've come across many blogs in the past in which I find the answers I was
  looking for, so trying to give something back, hopefully, someone finds it
  useful.
- You can also `subscribe to my RSS feed` if you'd like to find out what I'm up
  to.

## If you like my content, and want to support me

- I create and edit my videos in an m1 mac mini, and it's starting to stay
  behind in the editing side of things, tends to slow me down a bit, I'd like to
  upgrade the machine I use for all my videos to a `mac mini` with these specs:
  - Apple M4 Pro chip with 14‚Äëcore CPU, 20‚Äëcore GPU, 16-core Neural Engine
  - 24GB unified memory
  - 1TB SSD storage
  - 10 Gigabit Ethernet
- If you want to help me reach my goal, you can

## How do you manage your passwords?

- I've tried many different password managers in the past, I've switched from
  `LastPass` to `Dashlane` and finally ended up in `1password`
- You want to find out why? More info in my article:

## A bit about me

- My journey in the IT world started when I decided to get my Cisco CCNA
  certification back in 2018, but then I realized that networking is just a
  small part of the landscape, so I've been trying to catch up to new
  technologies ever since.
- I adapt quickly and connect the dots to understand how things work. If I don't
  know an answer, I'm not going to pretend I know and give you false
  information, I'll tell you to give me some time and come back with something
  useful. on a docker container in a GCP VM, I'll document the whole process in
  case I need to re-do it.
- I love taking notes, let's say for example I'm learning to deploy WordPress
- I used to manage my notes in Google Docs but it's too slow to load, so
  migrated all my notes to Obsidian, so now everything is handled as markdown
  files and automatically uploaded to my private GitHub repo.
