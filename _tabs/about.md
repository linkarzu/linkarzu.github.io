## Why did I create this site?

- I created this site to share information about topics that interest me, for
  example, Neovim, Linux, Obsidian, Docker, Kubernetes, networking, macOS
  productivity tools, etc.
- Its purpose is to share knowledge that I've found useful across the years,
  also accept other points of view/suggestions from people in the same path, I'm
  always interested in learning other ways if I can optimize my processes.
- I've come across many blogs in the past in which I find the answers I was
  looking for, so trying to give something back, hopefully, someone finds it
  useful.
- You can also `subscribe to my RSS feed` if you'd like to find out what I'm up
  to.

## A bit about me

- My journey in the IT world started when I decided to get my Cisco CCNA
  certification back in 2018. Then I realized that networking is just a small
  part of the landscape, so I've been trying to catch up to new technologies
  ever since.
- I adapt quickly and connect the dots to understand how things work. If I don't
  know an answer, I'm not going to pretend I know and give you false
  information, I'll tell you to give me some time and come back with something
  useful. If for example I'm working with a docker container in a GCP VM, I'll
  document the whole process in case I need to re-do it.
- I love taking notes, let's say for example I'm learning to deploy WordPress
- I used to manage my notes in Google Docs but it's too slow to load, so
  migrated all my notes to Obsidian, so now everything is handled as markdown
  files and automatically uploaded to my private GitHub repo.

## How do you manage your passwords?

- I've tried many different password managers in the past, I've switched from
  `LastPass` to `Dashlane` and finally ended up in `1password`
