## Why did I create this site?

- I created this site to share information about topics that interest me, for
  example, Neovim, Linux, Obsidian, Docker, Kubernetes, networking, macOS
  productivity tools, etc.
- Its purpose is to share knowledge that I've found useful across the years,
  also accept other points of view/suggestions from people in the same path, I'm
  always interested in learning other ways if I can optimize my processes.
- I've come across many blogs in the past in which I find the answers I was
  looking for, so trying to give something back, hopefully, someone finds it
  useful.
- You can also `subscribe to my RSS feed` if you'd like to find out what I'm up
  to.

## Is the blogpost my main medium?

- No, the blogpost at the moment is not the main thing I do, it is complimentary
  to my YouTube channel. Usually each article is related to a video
- So if you have questions related to an article, watch the video. Here's my
  [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@linkarzu){:target="\_blank"}

## A bit about me

- My journey in the IT world started when I decided to get my Cisco CCNA
  certification back in 2018. Then I realized that networking is just a small
  part of the landscape, so I've been trying to catch up to new technologies
  ever since.
- I adapt quickly and connect the dots to understand how things work. If I don't
  know an answer, I'm not going to pretend I know and give you false
  information, I'll tell you to give me some time and come back with something
  useful. If for example I'm working with a docker container in a GCP VM, I'll
  document the whole process in case I need to re-do it.
- I love taking notes, let's say for example I'm learning to deploy WordPress
- I used to manage my notes in Google Docs but it's too slow to load, so
  migrated all my notes to Obsidian, so now everything is handled as markdown
  files and automatically uploaded to my private GitHub repo.

## I'm confused, is there more than 1 podcast?

- Yes, I'm running more than 1 podcast, here's a small comparative table

- **Read each section below to understand their differences**

### Linkarzu Podcast - Neovim, macOS, Emacs, Linux, Terminals, and more

- This podcast is the first one, in which I interview other guests, like Kovid
  Goyal (Kitty Terminal creator), Sylvan Franklin (Vimothée Chalamet),
  DistroTube, etc.

> and chat during these interviews
{: .prompt-tip }
 
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

- All of these videos are edited, and shared with everyone **FOR FREE** a few
  days after, the live stream is for members only, but the edited version is
  made public once edited
- Is it uploaded to Spotify and other podcasting platforms?
  - Yes, I upload them to all the major podcasting platforms
  - If for a strange reason the "linkarzu" podcast does not show in your
    podcasting app, let me know and I'll add it
- You can find all the episodes in this YouTube playlist:
- [Linkarzu Podcast - Neovim, macOS, Emacs, Linux, Terminals and more](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZWMav2s1MZRr93uiz6vjEWCdXL93QzGz&si=NbJ6pXhXoKEXdo8V){:target="\_blank"}
- All the episodes are immediately uploaded to YouTube music without me doing
  anything:
  - [Link to Podcast in YouTube music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZWMav2s1MZRr93uiz6vjEWCdXL93QzGz&si=a7WJg4FxRVSwEetF){:target="\_blank"}
- For other platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, etc, I have to manually upload
  them to a podcasting hosting service, which means I have to export them as
  audio, and upload them. So I'm a little behind there.
  - If you don't see all the episodes, just give me some time and they'll
    eventually show up.

### What's the "Linkarzu CEOs Monthly Hangout" Podcast

- This is a monthly video live stream I'll have with the folks that pay for the
  [CEO YouTube membership](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrSIvbFncPSlK6AdwE2QboA/join){:target="\_blank"}

<!-- markdownlint-disable -->

> Anyone is able to join the live stream and chat during these calls, you don't
> have to be a YouTube member 
{: .prompt-tip }

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

- These videos are not edited, the live stream remains public and everyone can
  watch it right away.
- What's the goal?:
  - Make some money on the side, as YouTube ads pays me just pennies
  - Give people that can afford it some exposure
  - This is a win-win situation and a way to mutually support each other. So if
    you want to become a CEO it helps me, but it also helps so you can share
    about your service. It can be anything
    - I'd advise your product is tech related, because we'll be discussing tech
      related topics in the podcast
- It's really boring to listen to a podcast and just listen to people sell their
  products, is this what this is?
  - No, I hate `sales` videos as well, at the beginning of the video the guests
    share about their services.
  - After that we discuss interesting topics related to tech
  - For example, in the first episode we discussed `Kitty Sessions`, `Omarchy`,
    how `ThePrimeagen` has influenced us and more
- Is this an audio thing only, since it's a "podcast"?
  - No, this is a live stream, you can find all the episodes in this YouTube
    playlist:
  - [Linkarzu CEOs Monthly Hangout](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZWMav2s1MZR_E0s7OTicc7Th5QuWvUPx){:target="\_blank"}
  - The benefit of it being a podcast, is that all the episodes are immediately
    uploaded to YouTube music without me doing anything:
  - [Link to Podcast in YouTube music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZWMav2s1MZR_E0s7OTicc7Th5QuWvUPx&si=9y-NssvjRmlAVKIr){:target="\_blank"}
- Will these episodes be available on Spotify, Apple Music and all the other
  platforms?
  - I was planning on doing so, but to create multiple podcasts on my hosting
    solution [rss.com](https://rss.com/){:target="\_blank"} I have to increase
    the monthly payment from $15.99 to $24.99
  - I already pay the $15.99 out of my pocket, so not planning on increasing
    that.
  - `Buuuuut`, if 2 or more CEOs join, I'll gladly pay the extra fee.
  - This means more exposure to the CEOs, not only on YouTube but other
    platforms

## Where can I see future interviews and how can I chat in them?

- All the interviews with guests are transmitted as a live stream, but they're
  also recorded
- Each one of them is edited nicely with its respective chapters, and then
  released FOR FREE to everyone a few days after.
- These live streams are only available for YouTube members, so they can join to
  chat and ask questions
- If you want to see the scheduled live streams:
  - [List of upcoming live streams](https://www.youtube.com/@linkarzu/streams){:target="\_blank"}
- If you want to become a YouTube member to chat on these calls:

## You're a fraud, why do you ask for money, isn't YouTube Ads enough?

- I was asked this in
  [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1meuo52/comment/n74320l/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button){:target="\_blank"}
  in a very rude manner, calling me a fraud and all that good stuff
- The comment was deleted by the same user after my reply, but:

### Here's what I replied (grab your popcorn)

Now, joking aside, for other folks reading this, I do 100% agree that I owe
these interviews to my guests, I can't thank them enough. Prot and many of the
other guests have dedicated years of their life into researching and figuring
stuff out, to then share it with all of us in an easy way to understand. That is
just priceless, all of that work and dedication, that is usually tied to paid
education and years of experience, just being shared with us. So I admire and
have so much respect for the guests.

The reasons I do the interviews are:

- I want to learn about these topics and I do so from people that I admire
- I want to share the topics with my audience
- I want to share a bit of my audience as well with the guest, so they can
  subscribe and support the guest. Although my audience is quite small, but
  still there's some that recognize and appreciate the guests.

It may seem that there's not much work done on my side to publish these videos.
So I'll try to explain a bit. Not for the person that started the thread, but
for other folks that actually think it's just about hitting record, posting, and
then receive the big bucks in your bank account living the `influencer`
lifestyle:

- There's looking for the guest, reaching out and ask if they agree to an
  interview
- Scheduling the call and making sure timezone is not an issue
- Setting up the environment that allows both the guest and me to share our
  screen, my interviews are mo dynamic compared to stuff currently out there.
  Figuring this out and coming up with a system that works, took me months of
  work.
- Coming up with topics and questions to discuss
- Setting up the live stream on youtube, announce it on social media and discord
- Editing the video and add nice chapters to it. This means watching the entire
  thing, removing extra noises, or parts that shouldn't be in there, adding
  credits, images, animations, highlights section, etc.
- Several times I export the guests audio track, process it in the "Auphonic"
  tool to clean it up and "increase the quality a bit" (this is a paid service)
- Create a thumbnail, video description, and the rest of the YouTube related
  items
- In some cases, manually editing the captions in several hour long videos.
- Share the edited video in social media, discord, sometimes reddit
- Reply to comments on YouTube
- And the cycle starts over
- I'm not complaining, I love doing this, but keep in mind I'm a 1 man band, I
  do everything by myself, from start to finish. And keep in mind that I have a
  daytime job, wife, kids, responsibilities and I'm the single provider in my
  house. So all of this has to be done in my spare time, usually really early in
  the morning (6am) or when my work shift ends
  - Shout out to my wife, because without her taking care of most of the house
    related items, nothing would be possible. I wouldn't even have a YouTube
    channel to begin with, because she facilitates things so I can pursue this
    "dream" that at the moment gives me a few dollars every month. That is not
    even relatively close to help supporting my family.
  - And double shout out because she blindly believes in me and supports me
    100%, she says, as long as it makes me happy
- I have a video (for my members only) in which I show how much I made off of
  YouTube in the 1st year of having a channel. Yeah, shameless plug, but
  needless to say, it's not what you would expect or what you have in mind.
- So even if it may not look like it, I put a lot of work on my end too.

Now regarding my communication skills, I 100% agree, I'm not the best host.
English is not my first language and I've never studied anything related to
communication or media. I'm just a network engineer that's trying to learn and
share what I can, with the hope that some day, doing this, will actually support
my family.

Yeah, I get it, sounds like a lot of drama, but I just want to educate people
that really wonder what happens behind the scenes.

## What's the best way to support me? (pick one)

- As I shared above, YouTube is just a hobby right now, it does not provide for
  my family. My day time job does.
- The end goal is supporting my family doing what I do, which is sharing good
  quality content that helps the audience and me grow
- So to support me, the best way is with a recurring option. As bills are not a
  one time thing and supporting the family is something that needs to be done
  every month
- Here are my recommendations, preferred at the top

### 1. Become a YouTube member

- There's different tiers, each one with different perks:
  - You can watch all the interviews live and ask questions
  - Access to member only videos and courses
  - Name shown in credits
  - And more
- [Link to become a member](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrSIvbFncPSlK6AdwE2QboA/join){:target="\_blank"}
- YouTube keeps 30% of what you pay, but I don't care, it feels like a more
  integrated experience for the user, and it allows me to share members only
  content in the same platform

### 2. Monthly Ko-Fi donation

- Ko-Fi is like system to leave tips, I don't have it tied to any benefits or
  anything similar. All the benefits are tied to YouTube
- But you can donate if you want to support me
- [Link to donate in Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/linkarzu){:target="\_blank"}

### 3. Ko-Fi one time donation

- [Link to donate in Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/linkarzu){:target="\_blank"}

### 4. 1password free trial

- Do I even use this thing and believe in it? Or am I just trying to shove it
  down your throat and make some money out of it?
  - I've been using 1password for a while now. Before, I was using Dashlane for
    a couple of years, and before that I was using LastPass. I used to work for
    LastPass, handled many incidents in the past as I was in the NOC team for
    the parent company back then `LogMeIn`, now known as `GoTo` (They keep
    changing their name with every acquisition, so it'll change again)
  - Out of all the different password managers I've extensively used,
    `1password` is hands down the best. I have not tried any other ones, so
    there could be better ones
  - I wish they would sponsor me, but no, all I have is an affiliate link, and
    in theory I get a small portion in case you purchase 1password after the
    free trial
- If you want to learn more about it, I have this blogpost article:
  - [How I use 1password to keep all my accounts safe](https://linkarzu.com/posts/1password/1password/){:target="\_blank"}
- Link to use my affiliate link:
  - [Start your free trial](https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-101327218-15734885){:target="\_blank"}

### 5. Setapp free trial

- Do I believe in this, is it a scam?
  - I've been paying for setapp for quite some time now, you don't believe me?
    Why would I lie to you MF

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
![Image](./../assets/img/imgs/250819-setapp-bills.avif){: width="500" }
_setapp start date_

- I even upgraded my plan to use it on multiple devices and on my phone
- I have a video in which I go over how I use Setapp and the apps I use:
  - [Setapp Apps I use in macOS, Why and How](https://youtu.be/PTElkgpjMP0){:target="\_blank"}
- I also wish they would sponsor me, but they don't so I have an affiliate link
  in case you want to give it a try:

## People that support me (Thank You)

- In this list, you will find the people that support me with YouTube `CEO` and
  `Executive Producer` memberships.
- One of the perks is to have their name listed here, so they get a bit of
  exposure and you get to know them, and consider using their services
