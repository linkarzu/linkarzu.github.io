title: About this blog
---

I created this site to share information about topics that interest me, for
example, Linux, Obsidian, Docker, Kubernetes, networking, macOS productivity
tools, etc. Its purpose is to share knowledge that I've found useful across the
years, and also accept other points of view/suggestions from people in the same
path, I'm always interested in learning other ways if I can optimize my processes.

I've come across many blogs in the past in which I find the answers I was
looking for, so trying to give something back, hopefully, someone finds it useful.

I'm not that active on social media, but reach out via Linkedin if you want
to network.

## A bit about me

- My journey in the IT world started when I decided to get my Cisco CCNA
  certification back in 2018, but then I realized that networking is just a small
  part of the landscape, so I've been trying to catch up to new technologies ever
  since.
- I adapt quickly and connect the dots to understand how things work. If I
  don't know an answer, I'm not going to pretend I know and give you false
  information, I'll tell you to give me some time and come back with something
  useful.
  on a docker container in a GCP VM, I'll document the whole process in case I
  need to re-do it.
- I love taking notes, let's say for example I'm learning to deploy WordPress
- I used to manage my notes in Google Docs but it's too slow to load, so
  migrated all my notes to Obsidian, so now everything is handled as markdown
  files and automatically uploaded to my private GitHub repo.
