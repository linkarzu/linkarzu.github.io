## Why did I create this site?

- I created this site to share information about topics that interest me, for
  example, Neovim, Linux, Obsidian, Docker, Kubernetes, networking, macOS
  productivity tools, etc. Its purpose is to share knowledge that I've found
  useful across the years, and also accept other points of view/suggestions from
  people in the same path, I'm always interested in learning other ways if I can
  optimize my processes.
- I've come across many blogs in the past in which I find the answers I was
  looking for, so trying to give something back, hopefully, someone finds it
  useful.
- You can also `subscribe to my RSS feed` if you'd like to find out what I'm up
  to.

## If you like my content, and want to support me

- I create and edit my videos in an m1 mac mini, and it's starting to stay
  behind in the editing side of things, tends to slow me down a bit, I'd like to
  upgrade the machine I use for all my videos to a `mac mini` with these specs:
  - Apple M4 Pro chip with 14â€‘core CPU, 20â€‘core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine
  - 24GB unified memory
  - 1TB SSD storage
  - 10 Gigabit Ethernet

## How do you manage your passwords?

- Do you do like my wife?
  - Use a very strong password for all your different apps? What if that
    password is compromised, will your bank accounts and email also be
    compromised?
  - You have a "system" but anyway you keep forgetting your passwords all the
    time for applications that you don't normally use and have to reset them
    often?
- Have you heard about password managers?
- I have tried several in the past, LastPass (the company I used to work for), I
  also tried Dashlane for quite some time until they increased their prices way
  too much, so decided to try 1password
- Out of all of them, I would only recommend one, and that is 1password, what
  are the things I like about it?
  - I have the app on macOS and the browser extension, so when I need to create
    a new password in a new site, I easily do it and it's stored in 1password
  - I have the app on the phone as well, so I never have to be typing any
    passwords
  - I use an apple watch, so every time I need to unlock 1password, I just
    double tap on my watch and my password is autocompleted
  - It includes a 2FA (2 factor authentication option) that allows me to use the
    same app for `one-time passwords`. So it autocompletes my password, but then
    it also automatically completes my one time password in the sites I have
    enabled 2FA
    - This is a time saver, because I don't have to go to another application
      like `Microsoft Authenticator` or `Google Authenticator` to get the code,
      after doing it for a while, it gets annoying

- I'm not sponsored by 1password, and I would `NOT` recommend a product I don't
  trust and use every day
- I do have an affiliate link for `1password` that means that if you get a trial
  through one of the links below, **you help me keep this blogpost free of
  google ads, which tend to be very annoying and distracting**
- if you use an `ad blocker`, the link will be detected as an ad, because
  affiliate links are usually used for ads, but if you want to double check and
  make sure that the links are safe, you can use a tool like
  [VIRUSTOTAL](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/url){:target="\_blank"} to
  inspect the links
- Here are my 2 links if you would like to copy and paste them:
  - For individuals and families
    - `https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-101327218-15917064`
  - For Business accounts

## A bit about me

- My journey in the IT world started when I decided to get my Cisco CCNA
  certification back in 2018, but then I realized that networking is just a
  small part of the landscape, so I've been trying to catch up to new
  technologies ever since.
- I adapt quickly and connect the dots to understand how things work. If I don't
  know an answer, I'm not going to pretend I know and give you false
  information, I'll tell you to give me some time and come back with something
  useful. on a docker container in a GCP VM, I'll document the whole process in
  case I need to re-do it.
- I love taking notes, let's say for example I'm learning to deploy WordPress
- I used to manage my notes in Google Docs but it's too slow to load, so
  migrated all my notes to Obsidian, so now everything is handled as markdown
  files and automatically uploaded to my private GitHub repo.
