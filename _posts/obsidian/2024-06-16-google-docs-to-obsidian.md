## If you like this, and want to support me

- I create and edit my videos in an m1 mac mini, and it's starting to stay behind in the editing side of things, tends to slow me down a bit, I'd like to upgrade the machine I use for all my videos to a `mac mini` with these specs:
  - Apple M4 Pro chip with 14‚Äëcore CPU, 20‚Äëcore GPU, 16-core Neural Engine
  - 24GB unified memory
  - 1TB SSD storage
  - 10 Gigabit Ethernet
- If you want to help me reach my goal, you can [donate here](https://ko-fi.com/linkarzu/goal?g=6){:target="\_blank"}

## How do you manage your passwords?

- I've tried many different password managers in the past, I've switched from
  `LastPass` to `Dashlane` and finally ended up in `1password`
- You want to find out why? More info in my article:
  - [How I use 1password to keep all my accounts safe](https://linkarzu.com/posts/1password/1password/){:target="\_blank"}

## What is Obsidian

- It's a note taking app, or as they call it, a "writing app"
  [link to their website](https://obsidian.md){:target="\_blank"}
- Obsidian is available to download and install on
  - macOS
  - Linux
  - Windows
  - Android
  - iOS

## Warning

- Be careful when switching to obsidian because you will spend days, weeks, or
  like in my case even months setting it up perfectly, finding the best plugins,
  setting up templates to take your daily notes and in the end, after a couple
  of weeks, you will end up dropping everything and use it for what it is, a
  note taking app
- Don't invest a lot of time watching countless tuturials. Don't end up in the
  zettelkasten rabbit hole because you'll end up really confused and spend a lot
  of time, just start taking your notes in a way that works for you
  - Personally, all my notes are technical documents, so I use big files
  - I probably should switch to the zettelkasten method, but it's not something
    I want to invest time right now, because i know it will take me months

## Reasons to switch to Obsidian

- 1. Google docs take a long time to load, if you have big files that contain a
     lot of images, good luck
- 2. If you want to perform a general search in your main notes directory for
     specific words, you wont find all the results when using the "search"
     option in Google Drive
- 3. You need to have internet access to get to your notes, in Obsidian your
     files are stored locally but you can still back them up, I have mine in
     github
  - Yes, you can use the `Google Docs Offline Chrome extension` extension, but
    not a good experience
  - In the video I show you the `Git` community plugin that automatically syncs
    my notes
- 4. Files are saved as markdown files `.md`, so I can open and edit them in any
     text editor, not only obsidian, but even in my terminal with `neovim`,
     `vim` or even the TextEdit app (notepad)
  - Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting
    elements to plaintext text documents
  - In google docs, files are saved with the `.gdoc` extension and if you double
    click them they will be opened in your browser, you can also download them
    using the Microsoft Word `.docx` extension
  - Do you really want to manage your notes using the cluttered unintuitive
    distracting and slow Microsoft Word application?
  - Even if you use open source software like "LibreOffice" you'll encounter
    formatting issues
  - Some documents look good in Microsoft Office but when you open them in
    LibreOffice they don't look the same, or vice versa
- 5. Codeblocks support since using markdown files
- 6. I can upload my images to my Imgur account or store them locally
  - Demo on the video on how images are uploaded to imgur
- 7. Vim motions

## Mobile app

- There's a free Obsidian Mobile app, but if you want to have your files synced
  you have to pay for
  [Obsidian Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync){:target="\_blank"}
- I'm not exactly sure, I don't use it on my Mobile
- But if I need to read a note, I do it on the github mobile app, because I
  upload my notes to a **PRIVATE** github repo

## Recommendations

- If you want to configure a custom menu bar on macos using sketchybar

- If you want to jump around your apps using keyboard shortcuts using
  karabiner-elements
