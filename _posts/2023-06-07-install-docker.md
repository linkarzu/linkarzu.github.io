Up until a few weeks ago, every time I needed to install docker on a new Linux server, I'd go to the [official documentation page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/){:target="_blank"} and follow the steps for my specific distro, which is usually Debian. There are several installation methods, and I'd normally go with the `apt repository` one. 

This means setting up the repo, adding the GPG key, installing docker, etc. Not difficult, but you still have to go through the documentation to find the right commands and after installing docker a few times, it gets kinda tedious.

In the official documentation, there's also a method at the end that reads `Use a convenience script`, which is what will be covered in this guide. The only thing you need to remember is the URL in which the script is hosted.

> This guide applies if you'll install Docker Engine on a linux server, using one of the supported distros. This is not a guide to install Docker desktop on either Linux, Windows or Mac.

## Install Docker
Go to [https://get.docker.com/](https://get.docker.com/){:target="_blank"}
- There you will see detailed instructions on how to install docker, but below are summarized steps taken from the script. I'll be installing it on a newly deployed Debian 11.7 server

&emsp;
&emsp;

**First, download the script**
- Inspect it if needed and make any necessary changes (I.E, install a specific version)
- If you don't make any changes it will install the latest **stable** version
  - `-f` (--fail) - If HTTP response is 4XX or higher it will exit with a non-zero status
  - `-s` (--silent) - mutes the progress meter and error messages
  - `-S` (--show-error) - despite `-s` show errors if it fails
  - `-L` (--location) - follows HTTP 3XX redirects, in case the URL redirects to another one
  - `-o` instructs curl to write the output to a file instead of printing it

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o install-docker.sh
```

&emsp;
&emsp;

**(Optional)** Run the script with --dry-run
- A dry run means it won't install yet, so you can see what the script will do (see below)

```bash
sh install-docker.sh --dry-run
```

```bash
krishna@docker4:~$ sh install-docker.sh --dry-run
# Executing docker install script, commit: c2de0811708b6d9015ed1a2c80f02c9b70c8ce7b
apt-get update -qq >/dev/null
DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y -qq apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg >/dev/null
install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL "https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg" | gpg --dearmor --yes -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian bullseye stable" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
apt-get update -qq >/dev/null
DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y -qq docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin docker-ce-rootless-extras docker-buildx-plugin >/dev/null
```

&emsp;
&emsp;

**Run the script to start the installation (make sure to run it as sudo/root)**
- At the end of the installation, you will see the version installed, and also an important note at the bottom

```bash
sudo sh install-docker.sh
```

================================================================================

To run Docker as a non-privileged user, consider setting up the
Docker daemon in rootless mode for your user:

    dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh install

Visit https://docs.docker.com/go/rootless/ to learn about rootless mode.


To run the Docker daemon as a fully privileged service, but granting non-root
users access, refer to https://docs.docker.com/go/daemon-access/

WARNING: Access to the remote API on a privileged Docker daemon is equivalent
         to root access on the host. Refer to the 'Docker daemon attack surface'
         documentation for details: https://docs.docker.com/go/attack-surface/

================================================================================
```

> If you're planning on using this docker host in a Swarm cluster **do not** run the docker daemon in rootless mode. I did and it was a nightmare trying to figure out why my node wasn't able to join the cluster. Instead of doing that, I'll add my user to the `docker` group as seen below
- The `docker` group grants root-level privileges to the user. For details on how this impacts security in your system, see [Docker Daemon Attack Surface](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface){:target="_blank"}
{: .prompt-warning }

## Run docker commands without sudo

Notice that you cannot run `docker` commands without sudo
```bash
docker ps
```

```bash
krishna@docker4:~$ docker ps
permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Get "http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.24/containers/json": dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied
```

&emsp;
&emsp;

You need to create the `docker` group and add your user to it so that you don't have to run docker commands with `sudo`
- Notice that for my distro, the docker group automatically got created
- But if it doesn't, create it with `sudo addgroup docker` or `sudo groupadd docker` (depending on your distro)

```bash
cat /etc/group | grep docker
```

```bash
krishna@docker4:~$ cat /etc/group | grep docker
docker:x:998:
```

&emsp;
&emsp;

**Add your user to the `docker` group**
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker krishna
```

&emsp;
&emsp;

**Exit your shell and log in again. You will now be able to run docker commands without sudo**
```bash
exit
```

```bash
docker ps
```

```bash
krishna@docker4:~$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
```

&emsp;
&emsp;

And that's it, with a minimum of 3 commands that you can copy and paste from this guide, you'll have docker up and running without having to do `sudo`.
You don't even need to come back to the guide again in the future, all of the steps are listed in the [https://get.docker.com/](https://get.docker.com/){:target="_blank"} page.
