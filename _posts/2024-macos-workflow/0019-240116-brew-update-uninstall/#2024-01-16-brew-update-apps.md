## How to update brew apps

To see your outdated packages

```bash
brew outdated
```

Below command is just an example of what outdated packages look like

```bash
krishna.@.mini~/github/dotfiles-public on ÓÇ† main [!] took 14s
[24/01/16 16:51:15]
‚ùØ brew outdated
Warning: Cask gstreamer-framework was renamed to gstreamer-runtime.
htop (3.2.2) < 3.3.0
koekeishiya/formulae/yabai (6.0.4) < 6.0.6
alacritty (0.13.0) != 0.13.1
```

- Run an update to get the details of the latest versions of the packages
  - This will not update the packages, but you have to run it

```bash
brew update
```

Below command is just an example of what updating packages looks like

```bash

==> Caveats
==> htop
==> yabai
```

## Uninstall brew apps

Just do a brew uninstall, and the name of the package

```bash
brew uninstall git
```

## Brew cleanup

- As seen in the **upgrade** example command above, a cleanup is performed when
  you upgrade the packages, but if still, you want to perform a manual cleanup
  - This will show you which files will be deleted without actually deleting them

```bash
brew cleanup --dry-run
```

- This performs the cleanup
  - If you recently performed an upgrade, there won't be packages to cleanup

```bash
brew cleanup
```
