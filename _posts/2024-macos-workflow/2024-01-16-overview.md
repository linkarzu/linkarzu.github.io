## If you like my content, and want to support me

- I create and edit my videos in an M1 mac mini, and it's starting to stay
  behind in the editing side of things, tends to slow me down a bit, I'd like to
  upgrade the machine I use for all my videos to a `mac mini` with these specs:
  - Apple M4 Pro chip with 14‚Äëcore CPU, 20‚Äëcore GPU, 16-core Neural Engine
  - 24GB unified memory
  - 1TB SSD storage
  - 10 Gigabit Ethernet
- If you want to help me reach my goal, you can

## How do you manage your passwords?

- I've tried many different password managers in the past, I've switched from
  `LastPass` to `Dashlane` and finally ended up in `1password`
- You want to find out why? More info in my article:
  - [How I use 1password to keep all my accounts safe](https://linkarzu.com/posts/1password/1password/){:target="\_blank"}

## Do you want your terminal to look like this?

- In this video series we'll set up your terminal to look like mine, we'll use
  my configuration files and I'll guide you through every step of the way.
- We'll also go over the command line tools I use every day so you can
  understand how they work, and how to set them up
- As of Jan 27 2023, not all the videos are recorded, so not all the pages will
  be posted, but I'll update the pages as the rest of the videos are released.
