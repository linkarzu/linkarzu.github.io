## If you like this, and want to support me

- I create and edit my videos in an m1 mac mini, and it's starting to stay behind in the editing side of things, tends to slow me down a bit, I'd like to upgrade the machine I use for all my videos to a `mac mini` with these specs:
  - Apple M4 Pro chip with 14â€‘core CPU, 20â€‘core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine
  - 24GB unified memory
  - 1TB SSD storage
  - 10 Gigabit Ethernet

## How do you manage your passwords?

- Do you do like my wife?
  - Use a very strong password for all your different apps? What if that
    password is compromised, will your bank accounts and email also be
    compromised?
  - You have a "system" but anyway you keep forgetting your passwords all the
    time for applications that you don't normally use and have to reset them
    often?
- Have you heard about password managers?
- I have tried several in the past, LastPass (the company I used to work for), I
  also tried Dashlane for quite some time until they increased their prices way
  too much, so decided to try 1password
- Out of all of them, I would only recommend one, and that is 1password, what
  are the things I like about it?
  - I have the app on macOS and the browser extension, so when I need to create
    a new password in a new site, I easily do it and it's stored in 1password
  - I have the app on the phone as well, so I never have to be typing any
    passwords
  - I use an apple watch, so every time I need to unlock 1password, I just
    double tap on my watch and my password is autocompleted
  - It includes a 2FA (2 factor authentication option) that allows me to use the
    same app for `one-time passwords`. So it autocompletes my password, but then
    it also automatically completes my one time password in the sites I have
    enabled 2FA
    - This is a time saver, because I don't have to go to another application
      like `Microsoft Authenticator` or `Google Authenticator` to get the code,
      after doing it for a while, it gets annoying

---

- I'm not sponsored by 1password, and I would `NOT` recommend a product I don't
  trust and use every day
- I do have an affiliate link for `1password` that means that if you get a trial
  through one of the links below, **you help me keep this blogpost free of
  google ads, which tend to be very annoying and distracting**
- if you use an `ad blocker`, the link will be detected as an ad, because
  affiliate links are usually used for ads, but if you want to double check and
  make sure that the links are safe, you can use a tool like
  [VIRUSTOTAL](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/url){:target="\_blank"} to
  inspect the links
- Here are my 2 links if you would like to copy and paste them:
  - For individuals and families

## What is karabiner-elements and how to configure the mappings

- Karabiner-elements is a powerful and stable keyboard customizer for macOS.
- `NOTE:` After installing karabiner, you'll notice that the windows are all
  over the place, I want to keep my windows organized, so will configure and
  install a window manager, in my case yabai in a future video. That will enable
  the transparency effect on my terminal and other apps
- `NOTE:` GokuRakuJoudo is a famous karabiner.json manager, similar to what we
  will do here, but using the edn file format instead of typescript. I don't
  have the time or will to set it up, as my current configuration works fine for
  me. But if someone can explain the benefits over this approach it would be
  appreciated

## Install and configure Karabiner-Elements

- First, we'll install the package so its easier to understand how it works
  - Then I'll explain what karabiner is, and what its used for

```bash
brew install --cask karabiner-elements
```

- Open the `karabiner-elements` app
- Permissions window will popup, give the required permissions to both
  - `karabiner_grabber`
  - `karabiner_observer`
- I set up my mappings using the repo below
  - `https://github.com/mxstbr/karabiner`
  - This repo translates from manageable typescript code `rules.ts` (400 lines)
    to the karabiner configuration file `karabiner.json` (2500 lines)
  - Is this repo needed? No, but it's way easier to manage the mappings
- Karabiner will automatically load the configuration we set up in the dotfiles
  video `~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json`
- So mappings will start working automatically after installing it
- All my mappings can be found in the dotfiles directory (demo in video)
  - Alacritty `hyper+space+j`
  - Safari `hyper+space+k`
  - Obsidian `hyper+space+o`
  - Chatgpt `hyper+space+;`
    - Add it to dock in chrome, can also use safari, doesn't matter
  - Spotify `hyper+space+h`
  - Youtube `hyper+space+y`
    - Add it to dock in chrome, can also use safari, doesn't matter
  - System settings `hyper+space+'`
  - Visual Studio code `hyper+space+n`
  - Finder `hyper+space+f`
  - I have additional mappings to:
    - Navigate between tabs in my browsers
    - Increase volume up/down
    - Increase screen brightness up/down
    - Open raycast extensions
    - Execute BetterTouchTool commands
    - And much more (demo in the video)
  - If you don't have one of the apps installed, the mapping does nothing

---

- I like switching my raycast hotkey to hyper+g
- I also like configuring the paste app to use hyper+w

---

## configure automatic typescript to json translation

- All my mappings are statically configured at the moment, but you may not want
  to keep those, as I guess you'll configure your own
  - So that's what we're doing below. Every time the `rules.ts` file is updated
    we want that those changes are automatically applied to the `karabiner.json`
    file, so we use the `mxstbr` repo we saw above
  - Demo on how the file doesn't change automatically at the moment
- So we install dependencies and run the build

```bash
# Make sure to change to the mxstbr project directory
cd ~/github/dotfiles-latest/karabiner/mxstbr

# Installs the project dependencies. These dependencies are usually defined
# in a package.json file in the root directory of the TypeScript project.
# This is a one-time setup step unless the dependencies change.
yarn install

# This runs the `scripts` section in the `package.json` file
# Compiles the TypeScript code into a karabiner.json file based on the rules.ts file
yarn run build
```

- Every time we make a change to the `rules.ts` file, we have to run the
  `yarn run build` command to translate the changes to the karabiner.json file
  but running the build command every time would be extremely annoying, so we
  run a watch command which will run the build automatically if changes occur

```bash
yarn run watch
```

- That's a bit better, but we would have to manually run that watch command
  every time we are working with the mappings so that it applies the changes
- Instead, I want to run this watch command when the computer starts, so we have
  to create a LaunchAgent plist file

```bash
cat <<EOF >~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.linkarzu.karabiner.plist
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
  <dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.linkarzu.karabiner</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
      <string>/opt/homebrew/bin/yarn</string>
      <string>run</string>
      <string>watch</string>
    </array>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
    <key>StandardOutPath</key>
    <string>/tmp/karabiner_linkarzu.out.log</string>
    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
    <string>/tmp/karabiner_linkarzu.err.log</string>
    <key>WorkingDirectory</key>
    <string>$HOME/github/dotfiles-latest/karabiner/mxstbr</string>
    <key>EnvironmentVariables</key>
    <dict>
      <key>PATH</key>
      <string>/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/homebrew/bin</string>
    </dict>
  </dict>
</plist>
EOF
```

- Notice the file was created

```bash
cat ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.linkarzu.karabiner.plist
```

- Now that the file is created, I need to run it
  - If you don't get any warnings, that's a good sign

```bash
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.linkarzu.karabiner.plist
```

- Now I'll modify the rules.ts file, and changes will be applied automatically
- Just leave this running and you should be good

---

- If for any reason, you need to unload or stop this plist from running, run the
  command below, but keep in mind that the changes wont be automatic anymore
- You can also delete the plist file if needed

```bash
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.linkarzu.karabiner.plist
```

---

- To see the error and log files we created below

```bash
cat /tmp/karabiner_linkarzu.out.log
```

```bash
cat /tmp/karabiner_linkarzu.err.log
```

## Karabiner updates 2024 - video

- I released a follow up video in which I go over a few updates regarding my
  karabiner configuration as mappings as of November 2024
- One of the main updates was changing my hyper key from `shift` to
  `right command`, as it caused me forearm pain, so I'd recommend you do the
  same
- I also implemented new keymaps for example:
  - Copy to the clipboard by tapping `left command`
  - Paste by tapping `left option`
  - Send `cmd+tab` by pressing `control`
  - And way more
- I would highly recommend you watch the video below
