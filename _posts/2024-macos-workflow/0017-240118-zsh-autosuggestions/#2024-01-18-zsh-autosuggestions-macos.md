## How I use zsh-autosuggestions

- zsh-autosuggestions suggests commands as you type based on history and
  completions
  - To configure it go to my zshrc file

```bash
brew install zsh-autosuggestions
```

## Community-driven promotion

Do you want to promote yourself in my channel? I'm not talking about a company
like notion, brilliant, and all those other ones we're using to seeing. I'm
talking about you as a person, do you have a project, course, youtube channel or
product and trying to reach an audience?

If interested, pricing and all the details can be found
