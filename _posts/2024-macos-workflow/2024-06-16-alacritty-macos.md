## If you like this, and want to support me

- I create and edit my videos in an m1 mac mini, and it's starting to stay behind in the editing side of things, tends to slow me down a bit, I'd like to upgrade the machine I use for all my videos to a `mac mini` with these specs:
  - Apple M4 Pro chip with 14‑core CPU, 20‑core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine
  - 24GB unified memory
  - 1TB SSD storage
  - 10 Gigabit Ethernet

## How do you manage your passwords?

- Do you do like my wife?
  - Use a very strong password for all your different apps? What if that
    password is compromised, will your bank accounts and email also be
    compromised?
  - You have a "system" but anyway you keep forgetting your passwords all the
    time for applications that you don't normally use and have to reset them
    often?
- Have you heard about password managers?
- I have tried several in the past, LastPass (the company I used to work for), I
  also tried Dashlane for quite some time until they increased their prices way
  too much, so decided to try 1password
- Out of all of them, I would only recommend one, and that is 1password, what
  are the things I like about it?
  - I have the app on macOS and the browser extension, so when I need to create
    a new password in a new site, I easily do it and it's stored in 1password
  - I have the app on the phone as well, so I never have to be typing any
    passwords
  - I use an apple watch, so every time I need to unlock 1password, I just
    double tap on my watch and my password is autocompleted
  - It includes a 2FA (2 factor authentication option) that allows me to use the
    same app for `one-time passwords`. So it autocompletes my password, but then
    it also automatically completes my one time password in the sites I have
    enabled 2FA
    - This is a time saver, because I don't have to go to another application
      like `Microsoft Authenticator` or `Google Authenticator` to get the code,
      after doing it for a while, it gets annoying

---

- I'm not sponsored by 1password, and I would `NOT` recommend a product I don't
  trust and use every day
- I do have an affiliate link for `1password` that means that if you get a trial
  through one of the links below, **you help me keep this blogpost free of
  google ads, which tend to be very annoying and distracting**
- if you use an `ad blocker`, the link will be detected as an ad, because
  affiliate links are usually used for ads, but if you want to double check and
  make sure that the links are safe, you can use a tool like
  [VIRUSTOTAL](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/url){:target="\_blank"} to
  inspect the links
- Here are my 2 links if you would like to copy and paste them:
  - For individuals and families

## What is alacritty and why?

- Alacritty is a fast, cross-platform, OpenGL terminal emulator
- Why do I use it?
  - I've used iTerm for years, and I loved it, but I don't need all the extra
    functionality it provides, I don't need tabs, profiles, arrangements,
    integrated tmux, etc. I need a terminal that's simple, and is just a
    terminal, no addons. If I want to add something, I'll do it myself
  - Main reason why I switched to Alacritty is because I can save my config in a
    repo, and easily transfer that configuration to a new machine. No dealing
    with configuration files that I need to configure in a GUI
  - Another huge reason, is because I can only use iTerm in macos, I want a
    terminal that I can use in mac, Linux or even Windows, using the same
    configuration across OSs
  - That's it, I don't care if Alacritty is GPU accelerated, maybe I do, but
    don't notice the difference

## How do I install alacritty?

- If you're following my youtube playlist `2024 macOS workflow` you should have
  Alacritty installed and configured by now, that guide will also install the
  required fonts, alacritty themes and all that's needed, so it's the simplest
  way

---

- **If you're not following that playlist** and you want to install Alacritty on
  your own run the `brew install` command below
  - For this, you will need to have brew installed, if you don't have it
    installed yet,
    [watch this video](https://youtu.be/BEB7X78ivNM){:target="\_blank"}

```bash
brew install --cask alacritty
```

- Once you have alacritty installed, you need to edit the config file to modify
  it to your liking, run these commands to create the Alacritty config directory
  and files if they don't exist, if they already exist, nothing happens
- This will open the vim text editor to edit the file, so you have to paste the
  alacritty configuration found in my github repo (see link below)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/alacritty
vim ~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml
```

- Here's a link to my
  [alacritty configuration file](https://github.com/linkarzu/dotfiles-latest/blob/e5b1104383a685dab46f2a719567d735338a1023/alacritty/alacritty.toml)
  and the rest of my dotfiles
- Once you have pasted the config in the file, save it by typying `:wq` to
  "write and quit"
- Quit and re-open Alacritty and that should take care of it
