## Do you want your terminal to look like this?

- In this video series we'll set up your terminal to look like mine, we'll use
  my configuration files and I'll guide you through every step of the way.
- We'll also go over the command line tools I use every day so you can
  understand how they work, and how to set them up
- As of Jan 27 2023, not all the videos are recorded, so not all the pages will
  be posted, but I'll update the pages as the rest of the videos are released.
