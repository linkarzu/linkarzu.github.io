## Brew autocompletion

- Brew autocompletion does what it says, helps you autocompleting Brew
  commands when you start typing a command and press tab
  - To configure it go to my zshrc file
  - `https://github.com/linkarzu/dotfiles-public/blob/main/zshrc/zshrc-file.sh`
  - Add the `# Autocompletion settings` section
  - Also add the `# Brew autocompletion settings` section
