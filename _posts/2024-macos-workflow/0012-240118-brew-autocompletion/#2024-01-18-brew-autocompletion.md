## Brew autocompletion

- Brew autocompletion does what it says, helps you autocompleting Brew commands
  when you start typing a command and press tab
  - To configure it go to my zshrc file
  - `https://github.com/linkarzu/dotfiles-latest/blob/main/zshrc/zshrc-file.sh`
  - Add the `# Autocompletion settings` section
  - Also add the `# Brew autocompletion settings` section
  - Demonstration in the video

## Community-driven promotion

Do you want to promote yourself in my channel? I'm not talking about a company
like notion, brilliant, and all those other ones we're using to seeing. I'm
talking about you as a person, do you have a project, course, youtube channel or
product and trying to reach an audience?

If interested, pricing and all the details can be found
[in this other page](https://chirpy.home.linkarzu.com/about/#community-driven-promotion){:target="\_blank"}
