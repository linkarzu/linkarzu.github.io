## Increase macOS key repeat rate

- By default, when you leave a key pressed in macos, it takes ages to move the
  cursor where you need it, to solve that, you can decrease the key repeat rate

```bash
# Paste this very large terminal command, and then try to navigate back and forth, it will waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too slow
# Also open a file in nvim and navigate up/down
```

- In the terminal you are able to specify a value even lower that in the system
  settings
- Go to **Settings - Keyboard** and configure:
  - "Key repeat rate" all the way to **Fast**
  - "Delay until repeat" all the way to the right to **Short**
- To see what the current values for each the **Key repeat rate** and the
  **Delay until repeat** are

```bash
defaults read NSGlobalDomain KeyRepeat
defaults read NSGlobalDomain InitialKeyRepeat
```

- To lower the values
  [even more](https://gist.github.com/hofmannsven/ff21749b0e6afc50da458bebbd9989c5){:target="\_blank"}
- This first value is the `KeyRepeat` which is the actual rate at which the keys
  repeat
  - Default minimum is 2 (30 ms)

```bash
defaults write -g KeyRepeat -int 1
```

- This other value below is for the `InitialKeyRepeat` which is the delay before
  the key starts repeating
  - Default minimum is 15 (225 ms)

> **DO NOT** set this value **BELOW** to **10**, I did that in my macbook and was

> - Mi `mac mini` worked with this set to 15, but my `macbook` worked with 20
> - **Experimenting with kanata afterward, `50` is what worked**
> - Otherwise I would still get repeated keys, so experiment and see what works,
>   for now I'll keep everything at 50
> - If using a **wired** keyboard, you may go with lower values, I use a **glove80**

```bash
defaults write -g InitialKeyRepeat -int 50
```

- No need to reboot afterward, to apply the changes just `reboot your keyboard`
  - This tip was shared in the YouTube video by `rdnie`

- We'll learn to move through commands even faster in a latter video related to
  `zsh-vi-mode`

## You're a fraud, why do you ask for money, isn't YouTube Ads enough?

- I explain all of this in the "about me page" link below:
