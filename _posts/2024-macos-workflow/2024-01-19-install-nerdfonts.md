## If you like this, and want to support me

- I create and edit my videos in an m1 mac mini, and it's starting to stay
  behind in the editing side of things, tends to slow me down a bit, I'd like to
  upgrade the machine I use for all my videos to a `mac mini` with these specs:
  - Apple M4 Pro chip with 14‚Äëcore CPU, 20‚Äëcore GPU, 16-core Neural Engine
  - 24GB unified memory
  - 1TB SSD storage
  - 10 Gigabit Ethernet
- If you want to help me reach my goal, you can
  [donate here](https://ko-fi.com/linkarzu/goal?g=6){:target="\_blank"}

## How do you manage your passwords?

- I've tried many different password managers in the past, I've switched from
  `LastPass` to `Dashlane` and finally ended up in `1password`
- You want to find out why? More info in my article:
  - [How I use 1password to keep all my accounts safe](https://linkarzu.com/posts/1password/1password/){:target="\_blank"}

## Install nerdfonts

- `https://www.nerdfonts.com` is a Iconic font aggregator, collection, and
  patcher
- Different apps use nerdfonts, so we need to install a font package, else:
  - Starship fonts won't show up properly
  - Neovim symbols will nos show up correctly
  - Other apps that use symbols will display them incorrectly
  - Demonstration in the video
- Fonts were already installed automatically by my Brewfiles, but will uninstall
  them so you can see how it looks like without fonts

```bash
brew uninstall font-meslo-lg-nerd-font
```

```bash
# Terminal symbols don't look correctly
cd ~/github/dotfiles-latest/karabiner/mxstbr

# Neovim symbols don't show up correctly
nvim
```

- To install the fonts again

```bash
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
brew install --cask font-meslo-lg-nerd-font
# fc command to verify if fonts are installed
brew install fontconfig
```

```bash
fc-list | grep -i "Meslo"
```

```bash
fc-list | grep -i "MesloLGM Nerd Font"
```

- After this, close and re-open alacritty
