## How I use zsh-vi-mode

- vi(vim) mode plugin for ZSH, it allows you to navigate your terminal commands
  using vim motions
  - To configure it go to my zshrc file
  - `~/github/dotfiles-latest/zshrc/zshrc-file.sh`
  - Demonstration in the video

```bash
brew install zsh-vi-mode
```

like notion, brilliant, and all those other ones we're using to seeing. I'm
talking about you as a person, do you have a project, course, youtube channel or
product and trying to reach an audience?
