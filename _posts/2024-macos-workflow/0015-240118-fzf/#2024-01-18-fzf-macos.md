## How I use fzf

- fzf is a command line fuzzy finder
  - To configure it go to my zshrc file
  - `~/github/dotfiles-public/zshrc/zshrc-file.sh`
  - Demonstration in the video

```bash
brew install fzf
```

## Configure fzf after installing it

- In the **caveats** you'll see that to install keybindings and completion run
  the install script
- Below command will answer `y`, `y`, and `n` to the questions asked, see below why

```bash
echo -e "y\ny\nn" | /opt/homebrew/opt/fzf/install
source ~/.zshrc
```

- You will get 3 prompts, asking you you want to enable auto-completion,
  bindings and the shell config files, set the first 2 to `y` `y` to generate
  the `.fzf.zsh` file and install auto-completion and key bindings.
- Set the shell configuration files to `n` because I already have that added
  manually from my dotfiles `zshrc-file.sh`

```bash
``‚ùØ /opt/homebrew/opt/fzf/install
Downloading bin/fzf ...
  - Already exists
  - Checking fzf executable ... 0.45.0
Do you want to enable fuzzy auto-completion? ([y]/n) y
Do you want to enable key bindings? ([y]/n) y

Generate /Users/linkarzu/.fzf.bash ... OK
Generate /Users/linkarzu/.fzf.zsh ... OK

Do you want to update your shell configuration files? ([y]/n) n

Update /Users/linkarzu/.bashrc:
  - [ -f ~/.fzf.bash ] && source ~/.fzf.bash
