## Install starship

- Starship is a customizable prompt, allows me to add time, date, github status
  kubernetes information, etc to my prompt
  - To see all the different options that can be configured, to this page
    `https://starship.rs/config/#prompt`
  - To configure it go to my zshrc file
  - `~/github/dotfiles-latest/zshrc/zshrc-file.sh`
  - Demonstration in the video

```bash
brew install starship
```

```bash
cd ~/github/dotfiles-latest/karabiner/mxstbr
```

## Community-driven promotion

Do you want to promote yourself in my channel? I'm not talking about a company
like notion, brilliant, and all those other ones we're using to seeing. I'm
talking about you as a person, do you have a project, course, youtube channel or
product and trying to reach an audience?

If interested, pricing and all the details can be found
[in this other page](https://chirpy.home.linkarzu.com/about/#community-driven-promotion){:target="\_blank"}
