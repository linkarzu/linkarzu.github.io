## If you like this, and want to support me

- I create and edit my videos in an m1 mac mini, and it's starting to stay behind in the editing side of things, tends to slow me down a bit, I'd like to upgrade the machine I use for all my videos to a `mac mini` with these specs:
  - Apple M4 Pro chip with 14‚Äëcore CPU, 20‚Äëcore GPU, 16-core Neural Engine
  - 24GB unified memory
  - 1TB SSD storage
  - 10 Gigabit Ethernet
- If you want to help me reach my goal, you can [donate here](https://ko-fi.com/linkarzu/goal?g=6){:target="\_blank"}

## How do you manage your passwords?

- I've tried many different password managers in the past, I've switched from
  `LastPass` to `Dashlane` and finally ended up in `1password`
- You want to find out why? More info in my article:
  - [How I use 1password to keep all my accounts safe](https://linkarzu.com/posts/1password/1password/){:target="\_blank"}

## Why the switch?

- Simple, image support
- keep reading if you want to find out more

## What is alacritty?

- Alacritty is a fast, cross-platform, OpenGL terminal emulator
  [Alacritty website](https://alacritty.org){:target="\_blank"}

### Why have I used Alacritty so far?

- Here's what I like about Alacritty:
  - Store config in a single file and can upload it to github
  - cross-platform, can use it on macOS and Linux, even on Windows (yikes)
  - Simple terminal emulator that has all I need, I don't need it to have a
    tmux-like solution built-in, no tabs, no profiles, or anything else, just a
    terminal
    - I cannot live without tmux, but that doesn't mean I want it baked into my
      terminal emulator, I'll install it and configure it myself, if you want to
      know what tmux is and how I configure it
      [watch my tmux video](https://youtu.be/0aD7-EBnULc){:target="\_blank"}
    - Also, if you want to know how I navigate between tmux sessions using
      ThePrimeagen's tmux-sessionizer script,
      [I have a video for that as well](https://youtu.be/MCbEPylDEWU){:target="\_blank"}

- I go over why I switched from iTerm to Alacritty in
  [this video](https://youtu.be/Lk3D4GtIEsU){:target="\_blank"}
  - In that video I also go over how to configure Alacritty

## What is kitty?

- "The fast, feature-rich, GPU based terminal emulator"
  [kitty website](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/){:target="\_blank"}

### It sounds you liked Alacritty so much, why the switch?

- I've taken my notes as markdown files for quite some time now, I first fell in
  love with Obsidian, my wife (if you're reading this post, you wouldn't
  understand) heard me talk about it for months, but then, I was introduced to
  the new love of my life Neovim
- Ever since I started using Neovim, I spend all my time in the terminal either
  editing markdown files, tweaking my neovim config, working on scripts, or
  editing any other type of file that comes across
- But I kept going back to Obsidian to take and read my notes, and I hated that,
  even though I have keymaps configured to jump to each app,
  [link to my karabiner-elements video here](https://youtu.be/Cr35bp8yAzo){:target="\_blank"}
  - And yes, Obsidian has vim key bindings and vimrc support, but it cannot
    compete with all the keymaps and keybindings I have configured in neovim,
    for example:
    - Keymap to jump between markdown headings
    - Quickly open the outline and navigate it with vim motions
    - Select some text and surround it with `gsa"`
    - And many, many more
- But there was still 1 thing keeping me going back to Obsidian: Images
  - There you can easily paste and view images, which I could not in Neovim
  - Even though my markdown files are mainly text, there is a single reason why
    I sometimes need to add images: **screenshots for university courses**
    - That's it, I don't add any other images to my notes, unless strictly
      necessary
  - I'm now able to do that thanks to kitty
  - If you want to view and paste images in neovim, you can watch
    [this other video I have](https://youtu.be/0O3kqGwNzTI){:target="\_blank"}

## How do I install and configure Kitty?

- I use macOS, but if you're using Linux, steps should be similar
- For this, you will need to have brew installed, if you don't have it installed
  yet, [watch my brew video](https://youtu.be/BEB7X78ivNM){:target="\_blank"}
- Once you have brew installed, let's install kitty

```bash
# This installs the kitty terminal
brew install --cask kitty

# I am also installing the fonts I like to use currently with my kitty config
brew install --cask font-meslo-lg-nerd-font

# This also downloads the kitty themes and puts them in the directory where my
# config looks
mkdir -p ~/github/dotfiles-latest/kitty/themes/
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty-themes.git ~/github/dotfiles-latest/kitty/themes/
rm -rf ~/github/dotfiles-latest/kitty/themes/.git/
rm -rf ~/github/dotfiles-latest/kitty/themes/.github/
```

- If you want to use my kitty settings, you can find my config file in my
  dotfiles
  - [My kitty config file](https://github.com/linkarzu/dotfiles-latest/blob/940cbd0df21d0f81fa041d2dead187ce8085a8db/kitty/kitty.conf){:target="\_blank"}
  - Just copy the settings in my config file to your
    `~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf` file with the commands below

```bash
# If the file already exists its fine, you can run this command
mkdir -p ~/.config/kitty

# Or in case you are one of those VS code or nano guys, edit the file there
vim ~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf
```
