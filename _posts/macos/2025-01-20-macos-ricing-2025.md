- This is a starting point, if you have other tips, share them down in the
  comments section of the YouTube video or this blogpost
- I shared my setup in the `r/unixporn` subreddit, in case you want to go and
  check out other cool setups,
  [the link is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/1i4e52x/yabai_this_is_what_kids_are_up_to_these_days_am_i/){:target="\_blank"}

## Pre-requisites

### Homebrew

- I install all my apps through Homebrew, I don't like installing stuff through
  `.dmg` files, why?
- Because if I switch to another computer, I already have my brewfiles with the
  stuff I install all the time and I can install all the apps I need really
  quickly, usually through a script (I'll demo this some day)
- If you're new to `homebrew` and don't know how to install apps with it, check
  out my tutorial:
  - [02 - What is brew and how to install it in macOS](https://youtu.be/BEB7X78ivNM){:target="\_blank"}

{% include embed/youtube.html id='BEB7X78ivNM' %}

### Terminal

- I use Ghostty as of Jan 2025, I would recommend you to use a terminal with
  image support, if you're planning on using fastfetch, which is what shows you
  an image on your computer next to your stats, as seen below:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
![Image](./../../assets/img/imgs/250120-fastfetch.avif){: width="500" }
_fastfetch_

- If you want to setup Ghostty the way I do, and learn why I chose it as my
  default terminal, check this video out:
  - [How to setup the Ghostty terminal, is it just hype? READ PINNED MESSAGE](https://youtu.be/rCiq5CyFFhA){:target="\_blank"}

{% include embed/youtube.html id='rCiq5CyFFhA' %}

## If you like this, and want to support me

- I create and edit my videos in an M1 mac mini, and it's starting to stay
  behind in the editing side of things, tends to slow me down a bit, I'd like to
  upgrade the machine I use for all my videos to a `mac mini` with these specs:
  - Apple M4 Pro chip with 14‚Äëcore CPU, 20‚Äëcore GPU, 16-core Neural Engine
  - 24GB unified memory
  - 1TB SSD storage
  - 10 Gigabit Ethernet
- If you want to help me reach my goal, you can
  [donate here](https://ko-fi.com/linkarzu/goal?g=6){:target="\_blank"}

## How do you manage your passwords?

- I've tried many different password managers in the past, I've switched from
  `LastPass` to `Dashlane` and finally ended up in `1password`
- You want to find out why? More info in my article:

## Song to accompany the video (only for connoisseurs)

- I do not own the video below, but if you're my age (37 as of Jan 2025), you'll
  appreciate this song and will feel the power while you read this article
- Oh man, it brought back so many memories üò≠

## Tmux

### Tmux splits

- As seen on this image below, notice that we have the terminal (Ghostty), and
  it has 3 different splits or sections, notice the 3 numbers each with a
  different color

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
![Image](./../../assets/img/imgs/250120-tmux-splits.avif){: width="500" }
_terminal with tmux splits_

- These splits are created with CLI tool called tmux
- In the video I demo how I create splits, which you normally do with `ctrl+b c`
- I also demo how I navigate between the different splits, I do so with
  `ctrl+h`, `ctrl+j`, `ctrl+k` , `ctrl+l`
- If you don't know what tmux is or how to set it up and would like to learn all
  the different things I do with it, check this video out:
  - [My complete TMUX setup and workflow in 2024](https://youtu.be/AcLRyqjzqY4){:target="\_blank"}

{% include embed/youtube.html id='AcLRyqjzqY4' %}

### Is Tmux only for splits?

- No, in this demo I use splits to show different apps in different sections of
  the terminal, but I don't normally do this, the only scenario in which I use
  splits in real life, is when I'm working inside Neovim, and for some reason I
  need to quickly bring up my terminal
- I created a keymap that allows me to toggle the terminal `alt+t`, and if I
  switch to a file that is in a different directory in Neovim, the split will
  follow me and switch to that directory
- If you want to learn how to set this terminal toggle, check this video out:
  - [Neovim Toggle Terminal on Tmux Pane at the Bottom (or Right)](https://youtu.be/33gQ9p-Zp0I){:target="\_blank"}

{% include embed/youtube.html id='33gQ9p-Zp0I' %}

## Btop

- [aristocratos/btop](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop){:target="\_blank"}
- As the github page above says: _"Resource monitor that shows usage and stats
  for processor, memory, disks, network and processes."_
- You can see that on the image below:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
![Image](./../../assets/img/imgs/250120-macos-ricing-btop.avif){: width="500" }
_btop_

- My btop configuration file can be found in my dotfiles:
  [btop/btop.conf](https://github.com/linkarzu/dotfiles-latest/blob/main/btop/btop.conf){:target="\_blank"}
- You can also find the custom theme I use
  [themes/btop-theme.theme](https://github.com/linkarzu/dotfiles-latest/blob/main/btop/themes/btop-theme.theme){:target="\_blank"}
- I don't have a dedicated Btop video, but if you'd like me to create one, let
  me know down in the comments

## Fastfetch

- Fastfetch is what you see in the image below
- I used
  [dylanaraps/neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch){:target="\_blank"}
  in the past, it still works, but that repo has been archived, and all the cool
  kids are now moving to fastfetch, so I don't want to miss out

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
![Image](./../../assets/img/imgs/250120-fastfetch.avif){: width="400" }
_fastfetch_

- My fastfetch configuration file can be found here:
  [fastfetch/config.jsonc](https://github.com/linkarzu/dotfiles-latest/blob/main/fastfetch/config.jsonc){:target="\_blank"}
- If you're using tmux, you will have to set the logo type to
  `"type": "kitty-icat"` instead of the default `"type": "kitty-direct"`, or the
  image won't be shown
- This fastfetch setup is not something I came up with, the credit goes to this
  other repo which is where I grab the config from and slightly modified it:
  [waytoabv/Dotfiles](https://github.com/waytoabv/Dotfiles/blob/main/.config/fastfetch/config.jsonc){:target="\_blank"}
- I don't have a dedicated fastfetch video, but if you'd like me to create one,
  let me know down in the comments

## simple-bar and SketchyBar

- This bar replaces the default ugly and boring macOS menubar, it's not just
  something aesthetic, but it's something really useful.
- For example, one of the things I like about it is that allows me to see how
  many outdated brew packages I have, so I know when its time to update, also
  the microphone I'm using and it's input level
- In the video I demo both of the bars, you can see an image of them here

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
![Image](../../assets/img/imgs/250117-thux-simple-bar-sketchybar.avif){: width="500" }
_simple-bar above and SketchyBar below_

- If you want to learn how I setup simple-bar in detail, check this video out:
  - [Uebersicht simple-bar vs SketchyBar in macOS - Custom Menu bars comparison and full setup tutorial](https://youtu.be/hybbQI6CRek){:target="\_blank"}

{% include embed/youtube.html id='hybbQI6CRek' %}

## skitty-notes

- skitty-notes is something custom I came up with that allows me to keep track
  of the stuff I need to do during the day, or other days, video ideas, etc

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
![Image](./../../assets/img/imgs/250120-skitty-notes.avif){: width="200" }
_skitty-notes_

- It's basically a sticky notes app, but the main reason I came up with it, is
  that it allows me to use vim motions to edit text
- It's basically my neovim configuration (modified a bit) running inside kitty
- I have a full tutorial on how to set it up, you can find it here:
  - [skitty-notes - Markdown Sticky Notes app in Neovim in the Kitty Terminal](https://youtu.be/M0B_24d0MWw){:target="\_blank"}

{% include embed/youtube.html id='M0B_24d0MWw' %}

## Starship

- Starship is basically my terminal prompt

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
![Image](./../../assets/img/imgs/250120-starship-prompt.avif){: width="350" }
_starship prompt_

- It shows me useful information, for example the path I'm on, if I have any git
  pending changes, and the kubernetes cluster I'm on
- This is really useful for me, because at work I work with multiple clusters,
  so it allows me to see which cluster and namespace I'm on
- You can find my starship config here:
  [starship-config/active-config.toml](https://github.com/linkarzu/dotfiles-latest/blob/main/starship-config/active-config.toml){:target="\_blank"}

---

- My starship, btop, Ghostty, tmux, SketchyBar and Neovim themes are all applied
  dynamically, which means that from a single place I can switch the colorscheme
  in all of those different applications, so I don't have to be manually
  modifying the colors in multiple places every time I want to switch them, I do
  this with some custom bash scripts I created, if you want to learn how to do
  it, here's a video in which I go over everything in detail:
  - [Colorscheme selector to change the colors in kitty, tmux, starship, neovim, sketchybar and more](https://youtu.be/SBU2YRv02Mc){:target="\_blank"}

{% include embed/youtube.html id='SBU2YRv02Mc' %}

## Yabai

- If you pay close attention to all the images above, specially my terminal
  emulator Ghostty, you will notice that it's transparent and we can see the
  desktop background
- The way that I make my terminal transparent, and also the way that I manage my
  windows in macOS is using the yabai window manager
- Yabai can be configured in different modes, one of them is `BSP` and the other
  one is `stack`

### BSP mode

- `BSP` allows you to have multiple apps on the screen at a time, so if you open
  2 application in the same desktop, each app will use half of the screen, this
  means a few things:
  - If you use this mode, you have to be deciding where the apps will leave, on
    which desktop, for example, you want your terminal and browser to open in
    desktop one, spotify on desktop 2, slack and email on desktop 3, etc
  - If you analyze this, this adds a lot of extra overhead you don't really
    need, thinking where you want your applications to start and I didn't want
    to deal with that at all, so that's why I decided to go with the other mode,
    `stack`

### Stack mode

- `stack` allows you to keep a single application on the screen at a time
- This personally gives me the added benefit of less distraction, right now that
  I'm working on this article, I'm 100% focused on writing this, I don't have
  slack, or youtube or any other app on the side catching my attention, so this
  allows me to focus way more
- Additionally, I don't want to specify in which desktop each app starts, I
  don't care and I don't want to add that extra burden to my app management, all
  apps live in the same desktop, and if for example I need to switch to switch
  to the following apps I use the keymaps:
  - `hyper+a+j` -> Ghostty (my terminal emulator)
  - `hyper+a+k` -> Zen browser
  - `hyper+a+y` -> YouTube
  - `hyper+a+f` -> Finder or ForkLift

---

- To learn how I use yabai in `stack` mode, how I set my terminal transparent,
  and overall how I do window management in macOS, check this video out:
  - [Yabai configuration updates 2024](https://youtu.be/9SQG5ogWEug){:target="\_blank"}

{% include embed/youtube.html id='9SQG5ogWEug' %}

## karabiner-elements

- As you were able to tell above, I use keymaps to switch to my different most
  used apps, but that's not all
- I also have keymaps to switch to my different tmux sessions (notes, dotfiles,
  blogpost, docker containers, etc)
- I also have keymaps for some of my Raycast shortcuts, like to look for emojis,
  search for my raindrop bookmarks, perform a google search, search for youtube
  videos
- I also have keymaps to play around with some system settings, or execute
  scripts (restart yabai for example)
- I have other special keymaps, for example, if I tap `left cmd` it sends
  `cmd+c`, if I tap `left option` it sends `cmd+v` and many others like this
- To learn how I do all my different mappings to everything I mentioned above
  (and more), check out my karabiner-elements video:
  - [karabiner-elements configuration updates 2024](https://youtu.be/dqEiDVYRWLk){:target="\_blank"}

{% include embed/youtube.html id='dqEiDVYRWLk' %}

## Tmux sessions

- One of the questions I get asked a lot is, why do you use tmux? It's just an
  add-on that could be easily replaced by the terminal's functionality, Ghostty
  for example can do many of the things that Tmux can
- The main reason I use tmux, is because I don't want to marry to a specific
  terminal emulator, yes, I'm using Ghostty right now, but before that I had
  declared my love to WezTerm, and before that to Kitty, and before that to
  Alacritty, and before that to iTerm
- So as you can probably see, based on statistics, Ghostty, won't be the
  terminal that I'll end up with for the rest of my life, I don't want to learn
  its keybinds, I don't want to learn how to open tabs, manage sessions (if it
  has any) or anything else
- All my configuration is managed in Tmux, so I can switch between any of the
  terminal emulators I mentioned above, and my config will always be the same,
  my keymaps will be the same, the way of opening tabs and splits will also be
  the same. And this is what has allowed me to switch between the terminal
  emulators mentioned above with ease
- And yes, I do understand that tmux adds a bit of a delay because it's a layer
  on top of the terminal emulator, but I've accepted to live with that for now.
- The best feature that tmux offers me is sessions, I have a session for each
  one of my different projects (notes, dotfiles, blogpost, docker containers,
  etc) and that allows me to switch between projects really easily without
  typing commands or anything, just a keymap and I get to where I want
- This type of workflow of switching between apps and tmux sessions is not
  something I had thought about in the past, `ThePrimeagen` inspired this in one
  of his videos:
  [My Developer Workflow - How I use i3, tmux, and vim](https://youtube.com/watch?v=bdumjiHabhQ){:target="\_blank"}
- To switch between tmux sessions I'm using Prime's tmux sessionizer script
- I explain everything in detail in the video below:
  - [Primeagen's tmux-sessionizer and tmux-sshonizer-agen](https://youtu.be/MCbEPylDEWU){:target="\_blank"}

{% include embed/youtube.html id='MCbEPylDEWU' %}

---

- If on macOS, I also use the BetterTouchTool app, which allows me to run
  hyper+t+j from any app, not just from the terminal itself
- I have a video in which I go over BetterTouchTool in great detail:
  - [Advanced BetterTouchTool shortcuts that execute a set of actions like scripts](https://youtu.be/RBHCgEEluD0){:target="\_blank"}

{% include embed/youtube.html id='RBHCgEEluD0' %}

---

- Also remember about this video I had shared above:
- If you don't know what tmux is or how to set it up and would like to learn all
  the different things I do with it, check this video out:
  - [My complete TMUX setup and workflow in 2024](https://youtu.be/AcLRyqjzqY4){:target="\_blank"}

{% include embed/youtube.html id='AcLRyqjzqY4' %}

## Neovim

- This is the tool that I spend most of my day on, it's the tool I'm editing
  this current blogpost, and where I edit basically all the different files, it
  doesn't matter if it's something work related or personal
- I have plenty of videos related to Neovim, but if you're getting started, my
  personal advise is: Start with something simple, markdown
- I would highly recommend you to check my markdown workflow video, the 2025
  version:
  - [My complete Neovim markdown setup and workflow in 2025](https://youtu.be/1YEbKDlxfss){:target="\_blank"}

{% include embed/youtube.html id='1YEbKDlxfss' %}

## Share your tips

- You have cool stuff you want to share that would improve the way my macOS
  setup looks, or that would improve my workflow, please feel free to share them
  in the YouTube video comments or in this blogpost as well
