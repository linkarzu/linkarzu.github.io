title: Why 40 Keys Is All You’ll Ever Need
description: >-
  In this video, I break down why you only need 40 keys on your keyboard. I
  explore how layers actually work, how they affect efficiency, and why having
  fewer keys can make you faster and more precise. I explain what layers are,
  how I used them on my Glove80 keyboard and my MacBook, and how tools like
  Kanata changed my setup completely.

## All you need is 40 keys

For the longest time, I've been a promoter of not using layers in my keyboard,
or use the minimum amount of layers possible. So that's why I got a glove80
keyboard. So having access to as many keys as possible will solve many of your
problems, right?, Right?

For starters, what is a layer? When you type the shift key on your keyboard, it
activates a layer, which allows you to type another set of characters, uppercase
characters and other symbols, so `\` turns into `|` for example, or `.` into `>`

So that's all you need to know to understand layers. It's the same concept, but
instead of using `shift` we can use any other key to activate any layer that we
want.

To give you a quick example, here's my symbol layer which I press by holding
`left cmd` on my macbook keyboard, or the `bspc` key on my glove80.

I spent using my glove80 keyboard without layers like a year, why? Because I
didn't want my glove80 keyboard and my built-in macbook keyboard to be
different. I wanted them to be exactly the same, so I mirrored my built-in
keyboard config in my glove80, with a few misalignments, or let's better call
them mistakes on my part. Enter was on my pinky on the built-in keyboard, but on
my glove80 enter was on my thumb. I know, not ideal. But I rolled that way for a
long time.

Until I met kanata, which allows me to re-map my macbook built-in keyboard. So
now, enter is on my right thumb in both the built-in keyboard, and the glove80.
Same with backspace, it's on my left thumb in both the macbook keyboard and the
glove80 (demo of this in the video)

I have a proposal. Do you want to promote yourself in my channel? I'm not
talking about a company like notion, brilliant, and all those other ones we're
using to seeing. I'm talking about you as a person, do you have a project,
course, youtube channel or product and trying to reach an audience?. Probably it
will be a 15 second personalized add inserted into my videos. Just keep in mind
that the audience you're targeting is like you, open source loving, which means
broke and cheap. So you'll have to be creative and find a way to get them.
Keyboards seem effective (not even that, because they build them themselves)

I never got used to the numbers being 2 rows above the homerow, it's a big
stretch and I miss to type the right number a lot of times. F keys? They feel
like a kilometer away (yes, we're using the correct and universal system, miles
my ass). So this is how I started transitioning into a 40 key keyboard layout.

In guitar playing there's these techniques called economy fretting and economy
picking. Which basically teach you to play the guitar with the least amount of
movement as possible, saving on distance and energy, makes you faster, more
accurate, and of course, more efficient.

So this is where the "Linkarzu Law of economy" comes in place (making up
scientific terms is the new fashion, right?). Which dictates that each finger
should move a maximum of 1 position away from its resting place. I'm pretty sure
there's a scientific name for this already, but I just don't know it. This
applies for each one of the fingers, even the thumbs. (To understand this
better, refer to the video)

A big factor to consider here, is also your pinky finger, notice that it also
moves to the row on the side. Which a lot of people don't like, as it's the
"weakest" finger. If you've ever played the guitar, you know this is absurd. As
your pinky finger is used as much as any other finger out there. But if you have
the princess Diana hands, it is understandable why you don't want to use the
outer row.

Using this outer row allows me to place each one of my numbers and symbols in a
single layer, I don't have to be pressing chords or keeping symbols in different
layers. No. They're all accessible from a single place. (I show my symbol layer
in video)

So now, everything is 1 position away, like my navigation layer is on my caps
lock key (arrows and selecting text). I even have layers in other keys, like for
example my `s` key which I use to zoom, volume, change tabs in the browser, etc.

But Corne keyboards have 42 keys, there must be a scientific reason behind that
right? Probably there is, but I use what is known as "the rule of the limiting
factor".

On my built-in laptop keyboard I can only use the space bar and 1 more thumb on
each side. This is due to the extremely bad design of laptop space bar. I would
be a completely different story if the space bar on the built-in keyboard would
be the size of a regular key. That way you could have space and 1 more key on
the right hand, and space and one more key on the left hand.

There's a technique that a good friend of Discord suggested to avoid this design
inefficiency. Moving your homerow 1 row above on the laptop keyboard, so instead
of it being on `hjkl` you could have it on `yuio`. Wonderful idea, but I don't
feel like trying it. I'd rather keyboard manufactures instead would take their
heads out of their asses and design better built-in keyboards for power users.

This way you could have your thumbs resting on `n` and `c` and use `b and m` on
the right-hand, and `v and x` on the left-hand as additional keys. Unlocking the
3 thumb keys on the Corne for each hand.

You could try to reach the 2nd modifier with your thumb, but that breaks our
rule of 1 position away, so that's out of question, and it's a huge stretch.
Same exact scenario with the number row.

I did the experiment, I got used to this layout, then I tried going back to the
number row and using my thumb to go over 1 position. And it feels like switching
your guitar for another one with a really high action (distance between frets
and strings). In other words, it does not feel effective, it feels tiring and
that you're putting more work.

Do I recommend less than 40 keys? I don't. I don't like to be playing around
with multiple layers for symbols, and playing tricks just to be able to type an
uppercase letter. You definitely need the outer pinky layer to keep things more
sane, and to respect the rule of each finger moving 1 position away.

It all depends who you ask this to. Yesterday I asked my wife. What would you do
if I remapped your macbook built-in keyboard and I would remove the number row,
the f keys, modifier keys, just leave the space bar. She literally looked at me
with this face

And told me she would throw the keyboard in my face

What do you think? What layout do you use? Will you give this a try and let me
know in the comments? Does it make sense? I convinced you right? It sounds
really scientific and like the best thing ever, and it is.
