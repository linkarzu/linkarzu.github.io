  Glove80 Keyboard new Silent Switches | Plum Blossom vs Red Pro | Typing test |
  My thoughts
description: >-
  I recently reviewed the glove80 keyboard, the switches that I have used for 5
  months are the Kailh's Choc v1 Red Pro, but I was waiting on a new set of
  switches released around a month ago, these are the Kailh's silent Choc v1
  Plum Blossom

## How do you manage your passwords?

- I've tried many different password managers in the past, I've switched from
  `LastPass` to `Dashlane` and finally ended up in `1password`
- You want to find out why? More info in my article:

## Sound test comparing plum blossoms and red pros

- You'll be able to listen to the difference between the 2 switches in the video
- Bottom line: the plum blossom switches are silent, and the red pro's are not
  silent

## My thoughts comparing both switches

- In the video, I talk about how I felt that the red pro switches slowed me down
  while typing
- I felt the plum blossom switches way more comfortable to type
- They also feel way more stable, and the reason for this is that they were
  designed that way
- Also keep in mind that these plum blossom switches were specifically designed
  for the glove80
- The image you see below is **not** for the plum blossoms, but you'll be able
  to read the `off-center` design, which adds the stability I'm talking about

- On the image below you'll be able to see the technical differences between the
  2 switches
  ([image found here](https://www.moergo.com/pages/glove80-key-switches){:target="\_blank"}){:target="_blank"}
- The main differences are:
  - Both of them are `linear` switches, but the plum blossoms are silent, and
    personally I love silent switches
  - The other difference is actuation force, the plum blossoms are around `10gf`
    heavier (more on this later)

_Notice the technical differences between the 2 switches_

- Personally, I feel the plum blossoms way more stable to type on, the feel
  smoother, they are silent, you feel more of like a response from the switch
  after typing, I don't know, I just love how they feel, but there's a big but
  here, more on that at the end

- I have a full tutorial on the glove80, in which I cover my layout, how you can
  make changes and upload a new firmware, and my thoughts related to the
  keyboard, you can see the entire thing in the video below:

## I removed the palm rests

- If you notice in the video, I don't have the palm rests attached anymore,
  there's 2 reasons:
  - The keyboard is way smaller, like around half its size, so its way easier to
    carry around. With palm rests I feel it looks way too big
  - It allows me to reach the numbers easily. When I have the palm rests
    attached, my palms are resting on them, so it's harder for me to reach the
    numbers, I have to lift of the palm and then get to the number row, I don't
    experience that without the palm rests, I just type numbers easily

## Should I try the voyager?

- I've heard so many people recommend the voyager, I like the fact that it's a
  really small and compact keyboard, it's really easy to carry around
- I've thought about it, and I think there's a few things I'll be missing:
  - Bluetooth support to connect multiple devices:
    - With the glove80 I can connect to my work (ex work) and also the personal
      computer, I just press a key and it switches 3 things, my monitor, my
      mouse is also switched to the other computer and the keyboard, I wouldn't
      be able to do this with a voyager, as it doesn't have Bluetooth
      capabilities, unless I use a KVM switch or something
  - I would be missing keys, I'm used to all the keys that the glove80 has,
    because I have them mapped to different functions, for example, if I tap the
    `right_arrow` key, it's going to switch me over to the `skitty-notes` app on
    the right. Also for example, if I type `left_command` it sends `cmd+c` to
    copy, and with `left_option` it sends `cmd+v` to paste. To get a better idea
    on all the different keys I use, and what I use them for look at the image
    below

- If you want to know how I switch my 3 devices between 2 computers by tapping a
  single key on my keyboard, I have a video in which I cover all of this:

- To learn how I do all my different mappings, including when I type
  `left_command` it sends `cmd+c` to copy, and with `left_option` it sends
  `cmd+v` to paste, how I switch between apps, change system settings, switch
  between tmux sessions and way more, check out my karabiner-elements video:

## Which switches should you get

<!-- markdownlint-disable -->

<!-- tip=green, info=blue, warning=yellow, danger=red -->

{: .prompt-danger }
 
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

- I have only tried 2 switches, the `red pro` and the `plum blossoms`, out of
  those 2, in the video I recommended the `plum blossoms` 100%
- I love how the plum blossoms feel when you type and their stability, and the
  fact that they are silent
- **bbbbbbuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut**
- After using the plum blossoms for around a month, my fingers started to hurt,
  at first it felt like my fingertips were getting numb, I felt them tickly
- First I thought it was the palm rests, since I had removed them, so I added
  them back, but the pain didn't go away
- Then I started to feel pain in the entire finger, in the joints, felt like
  arthritis, maybe MF just getting old and weak
- So I decided to switch back to the red pros, and after a few days of use, the
  pain is not there anymore. I still feel some residual pain, but is going away,
  it feels 90% better now
- Keep in mind that I come from a magic keyboard, which is really soft and for
  weak hands, so if you also have bitch's hands, don't get a man switches, If
  you like silent switches, I would probably recommend you to get the
  `cherry blossoms` as they're similar to the plum blossoms, but softer or if
  you don't like silent switches, probably get the ones I'm using right now,
  which are the `red pros`
- I cannot 100% recommend the cherry blossoms, because I haven't tried them, I'm
  just guessing, but if you'd like me to test them and compare them to the red
  pros and the plum blossoms, leave a comment in the YouTube video
  `"Please Stephen, send him the cherry blossom switches"`
