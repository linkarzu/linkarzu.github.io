## Introduction

- I'll clear the confusion on what Neovide is, I didn't get it quite well until
  I installed it and I'll show it's possible benefits

## A link to my guide will be in the video description

## Daily progress and WPM

### Day-1 240821

- When I first got the keyboard I could barely type, **not even 30 WPM**
- At the end of the first day after typing for around 3 hours, I could type
  **around 60 WPM**
- My regular typing speed on a regular keyboard is around 100 WPM
- I find it really difficult to press shift for uppercase letters
- space and backspace are not too difficult, although my pinky stretches to hit
  backspace at times
- Enter is a bit tricky too, but not as difficult as shift
- Numbers and symbols I'm not even typing them yet, want to get used to letters
  first

### Day-2 240822

- Today I realized that I hit the `0`, `-` and `=` keys with my ring finger instead
  of my pinky
- And honestly, after testing for a while, I'll keep doing this even in the
  glove 80, the pinky has to stretch too much to reach those keys
- I will also use the ring finger to press tilde and tab
- I switched the shift key to its traditional position and rearranged the
  modifier keys
- **By the end of the day, typing at around 66 WPM**
- My hands still find it a bit difficult to initially find their position in the
  keyboard, if I grab the mouse, I have to use my eyes to put the hand back in
  the correct position

### Day-3 240823

- Today I figured out how to press a single key to do 2 things:
  - Switch the keyboard to a different device (laptop)
  - Switch the input source on my monitor to that other device
  - If you'd like to learn how I achieve that, leave a comment in the youtube
    video
- **At the end of today I'm typing 78 WPM**
- I put screws on the keyboard legs so its more stable and its height does not
  adjust
- I tried using it with all the legs flat, but it moved forward a bit, so that's
  why gave it some height and its way better

### Day-4 240824

- I fully switched to the keyboard since yesterday, today my fingers find their
  place faster and I feel more comfortable
- I typed today 85 WPM in a test, so I'm increasing a bit

### Day-5 240825

- I tried a couple of tests today, and was around 80 - 84 WPM

### Day-9 240829

- I created my `monkeytype` account to keep track of my WPM history
- Noticed that I'm still not used to the keys being in a straight line, so still
  have a lot of typos due to that but getting better

### Day-10 240830

- Today I configured caps lock as shift, and if pressed alone its escape
- I'm slower as I have to get used to the position of the new shift key
- The goal is to have 1 key to do both functions
- I'm also using the pinkies for the last 2 rows, instead of my ring fingers,
  it's less of a stretch

## Pros and cons

### Cons

- I use macOS, and before this I had a magic keyboard with touch ID, that is now
  gone but since I have an Apple Watch, I can unlock stuff that way
