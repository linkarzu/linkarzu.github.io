## Disclaimer

- I'm not sponsored by [Moergo](https://www.moergo.com/) (I wish I was, and that
  they would send me free stuff ðŸ¤£)
- I bought the keyboard with my own money and they haven't sent any products for
  me to test that would bias my judgement
- So the review in this video is 100% mine so you'll get my honest and personal
  point of view

## Introduction

- Before purchasing this split keyboard I was suffering from left forearm pain
  to the point that I could not type for long periods of time anymore
- Across many posts or articles on the web you'll come across this `RSI` term,
  in case you don't know what it means (like me), here's a definition
- _"Repetitive strain injury (RSI) is a term sometimes used for pain caused by
  repeated movement of part of the body. It often gets better on its own, but
  there are things you can do to help speed up your recovery."_
  - [source for this](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/repetitive-strain-injury-rsi/)

## A link to my guide will be in the video description

- So you can follow along or review it later

## If you like this, and want to support me

- I create and edit my videos in an m1 mac mini, and it's starting to stay
  behind in the editing side of things, tends to slow me down a bit, I'd like to
  upgrade the machine I use for all my videos to a `mac mini` with these specs:
  - Apple M4 Pro chip with 14â€‘core CPU, 20â€‘core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine
  - 24GB unified memory
  - 1TB SSD storage
  - 10 Gigabit Ethernet

## Be careful with the hyper key you choose

- I use keymaps for basically everything, for example
- To switch to all my apps:
  - The terminal `hyper+t+j`
  - The browser `hyper+t+k`
  - YouTube app `hyper+t+y`
- To open:
  - my [Raindrop Bookmarks](https://youtu.be/ew9ItaL4zh8) in Raycast `hyper+r+j`
- To restart:
  - The [Yabai window manager](https://youtu.be/9SQG5ogWEug) `hyper+u+o`
  - The [Ghostty terminal](https://youtu.be/rCiq5CyFFhA) `hyper+u+g`
- To switch tabs in the browser `hyper+s+h` and `hyper+s+l`
- And these are just a few, I have a video in which I go over all of this in
  detail:
  [karabiner-elements configuration updates 2024](https://youtu.be/dqEiDVYRWLk)
- So when I started doing this, my hyper key was set to `caps lock`, you will
  see that recommendation in many tutorials and blogs, but I learned the hard
  way that it's not the best option
- If you'll be using a lot of keyboard mappings the way I do, you'll be using
  your hyper key a lot, so if you set it to `caps lock` your pinky will suffer
  and you will end up with forearm pain in the long run
- That's why I switched my `hyper` key to the `right command` key, which now I
  press with my thumb
- **It does not matter if I'm on the glove80 or the regular laptop keyboard, the
  hyper key will be on my thumb**

## My keyboard layout

- I'm using the numbers in the regular position intentionally, I could have used
  a layer for symbols and number but I'm not doing this, as I don't want to
  suffer when I switch to the laptop and have to re-learn to type without a
  glove80
- My end goal is to stay as close as possible to a regular keyboard layout so
  that I can switch between keyboards without having to re-learn stuff
- Below you will see how my layer 0 compares to
  [Moergo's default macOS layout](https://my.glove80.com/)

- TIPS:
  - I don't use `ESC` and `shift` so I'll just remove the keys, because I
    re-mapped them with karabiner or another tool, right?
    - I did this, until I needed to use escape or shift when first logging in,
      but I was unable to since karabiner is not loaded yet. So lave the keys
      there, or at least put them in another layer
    - Otherwise, good lock if:
      - Your password has uppercase characters
      - You're in macOS recovery mode or in the BIOS trying to hit escape

## Why I don't use layer 1 or 2?

- I don't want to be dependent on the keyboard, let's say that I decide to
  switch from a Glove80 keyboard to a kinesis, or even a better example, if I
  have to switch to my laptop which uses a regular keyboard, I won't have those
  layers there, and my typing experience will be completely different
- I'll probably implement a second layer for numbers and symbols but using
  karabiner, so I can use it with the glove80 and my regular keyboard

## Demo to change keys

- Live demo

## Next video

- I'm waiting for my new switches so will release a follow up video
- What questions do you have or would like to know in the next video?

## Will soon manage the config in github

- I still do it manually

## Daily progress and WPM

### Day-1 240821

- When I first got the keyboard I could barely type, **not even 30 WPM**
- At the end of the first day after typing for around 3 hours, I could type
  **around 60 WPM**
- My regular typing speed on a regular keyboard is around 100 WPM
- I find it really difficult to press shift for uppercase letters
- space and backspace are not too difficult, although my pinky stretches to hit
  backspace at times
- Enter is a bit tricky too, but not as difficult as shift
- Numbers and symbols I'm not even typing them yet, want to get used to letters
  first

### Day-2 240822

- Today I realized that I hit the `0` and `-` keys (also `=` on regular
  keyboards) with my ring finger instead of my pinky
- And honestly, after testing for a while, I'll keep doing this even in the
  glove 80, the pinky has to stretch too much to reach those keys
- I will also use the ring finger to press tilde and tab
- I switched the shift key to its traditional position and rearranged the
  modifier keys
- **By the end of the day, typing at around 66 WPM**
- My hands still find it a bit difficult to initially find their position in the
  keyboard, if I grab the mouse, I have to use my eyes to put the hand back in
  the correct position

### Day-3 240823

- Today I figured out how to press a single key to do 2 things:
  - Switch the keyboard to a different device (laptop)
  - Switch the input source on my monitor to that other device
  - If you'd like to learn how I achieve that, leave a comment in the youtube
    video
- **At the end of today I'm typing 78 WPM**
- I put screws on the keyboard legs so its more stable and its height does not
  adjust
- I tried using it with all the legs flat, but it moved forward a bit, so that's
  why gave it some height and its way better

### Day-4 240824

- I fully switched to the keyboard since yesterday, today my fingers find their
  place faster and I feel more comfortable
- I typed today 85 WPM in a test, so I'm increasing a bit

### Day-5 240825

- I tried a couple of tests today, and was around 80 - 84 WPM

### Day-9 240829

- I created my `monkeytype` account to keep track of my WPM history
- Noticed that I'm still not used to the keys being in a straight line, so still
  have a lot of typos due to that but getting better

### Day-10 240830

- Today I configured caps lock as shift, and if pressed alone its escape
- I'm slower as I have to get used to the position of the new shift key
- The goal is to have 1 key to do both functions
- I'm also using the pinkies for the last 2 rows, instead of my ring fingers,
  it's less of a stretch

### 241013

- Today, Oct 13th 2024, I charged the battery to 100%, want to see how long it
  lasts
- 2 computers connected via Bluetooth
- no lights

### 241028

- The left side of the keyboard ran out of battery today and turned off
- Right side of the keyboard battery is still 5/6
- Not sure if this is a firmware issue or an issue with the battery itself on
  the left half

## Authenticate sudo commands with apple watch

- When you run sudo commands in your terminal, you're normally asked for the
  password. If you have a keyboard with touch ID, you can use that to
  authenticate
- If you use a glove80 you can't do that anymore, or at least you thought you
  couldn't, but yes you can, here is how
- [Terminal SUDO authentication with apple watch on macOS (without touch ID)](https://youtu.be/Ddb0viKux9A){:target="\_blank"}

## Pros and cons

### Pros

- My forearm pain is gone, but remember to read the
  [Be careful with the hyper key you choose](#be-careful-with-the-hyper-key-you-choose)
- Looks cool and people will think you're smart ðŸ¤£

### Cons

- I use macOS, and before this I had a magic keyboard with touch ID, that is now
  gone but since I have an Apple Watch, I can unlock stuff that way
  - So the solution is to buy an apple watch, your wife will be excited when you
    tell her you'll purchase a glove80 and an apple watch
  - (apple, come and read this ðŸ‘†, and sponsor me)
- It ain't cheap

## Do I recommend buying the glove80?

- This is the first ever mechanical and split keyboard I use in my life, before
  this I've used Apple's magic keyboard for many years
- This means I have no point of comparison on what to recommend, I was
  indecisive between 2 keyboards, the glove80, and the
  [kinesis Advantage360](https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/adv360/){:target="\_blank"}
- I have not tried a keyboard `without` the concave key wells, but if you're not
  used to them, it may feel a bit extreme
- I'd like to try a flat split keyboard with multiple thumb keys (I need at
  least 4 thumb keys on each hand) and compare it to the glove80, but that
  translates to money, so I don't see that happening any time soon, if I do,
  I'll release a video
