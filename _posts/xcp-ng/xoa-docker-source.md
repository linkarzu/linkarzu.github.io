## YouTube video

{% include embed/youtube.html id='cY1KSeIkQCs' %}

## Disclaimer

- I use the [lazyvim.org](https://www.lazyvim.org){:target="\_blank"} neovim
  distribution, which comes with a lot of defaults

## Introduction

- I'll clear the confusion on what Neovide is, I didn't get it quite well until
  I installed it and I'll show it's possible benefits

## Community-driven promotion

Do you want to promote yourself in my channel? I'm not talking about a company
like notion, brilliant, and all those other ones we're using to seeing. I'm
talking about you as a person, do you have a project, course, youtube channel or
product and trying to reach an audience?

If interested, pricing and all the details can be found
[in this other page](https://chirpy.home.linkarzu.com/about/#community-driven-promotion){:target="\_blank"}

## You're a fraud, why do you ask for money, isn't YouTube Ads enough?

- I explain all of this in the "about me page" link below:
