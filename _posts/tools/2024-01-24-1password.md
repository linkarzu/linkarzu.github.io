## Do you manage your passwords the same way my wife does?

- Let me guess:
  - You use the same `but very strong unhackable password` for all your
    different services?
  - Or better yet:
    - You have a "system" that helps you set the password for every different
      service, but somehow you keep forgetting them all the time and have to
      reset them often?
- Have you ever wondered:
  - What if your `very strong unhackable password` gets compromised or leaked by
    one of those companies that don't take security too seriously, will your
    bank accounts and email also be compromised?
  - Spoiler alert: **Sure they will**

## What are password managers?

- They're a service (application) that allows you to set random but secure
  passwords on each one of your apps/services, and keeps them stored locally and
  securely in your devices, so you don't have to remember multiple passwords
  anymore
- You just login to your password manager, and it will automatically fill out
  the passwords for you, when you go to a website
- So for example, let's say I'm setting up a new `gmail` account, I go through
  the setup process, when I get asked to set a new password, the password
  manager will automatically create it for me and store it.
- The next time I log into that email account, the password manager will
  automatically fill it up for me
- For obvious reasons, you **SHOULD NEVER** use the `master password` in your
  password manager, as the password in any of your other apps, in case that
  those other apps leak your `master password`

## Which password manager should I choose?

- That's up to you to decide, the great thing is that most of them offer **free
  trials**, so you can compare
- I have used several in the past, for many years, `LastPass` (the company I
  used to work for), I also used `Dashlane` for quite some time until they
  increased their prices way too much, so I decided to try `1password`
- I could be biased, and recommend `LastPass` for example, but out of all of
  them, I would only recommend the one that I personally like the best, and that
  is `1password`

## What do I like about 1password

- On my computer, I have `both` the `desktop` macOS app and also the browser
  extension
  - So when I need to create a new password in a new site, I easily do it from
    the browser extension and it's automatically stored in 1password
  - If I need to log in to a site on my browser, the extension automatically
    fills out the password for me
- I have the app on the phone as well, so I never have to be typing any
  passwords on the hideous phone keyboard
- I use an apple watch, so every time I need to unlock 1password, I just double
  tap on my watch and my password is autocompleted
- It includes a **2FA (2 factor authentication option)** that allows me to use
  the same app for `one-time passwords`. So it autocompletes my password, but
  then it also automatically completes my one time password in the sites I have
  enabled 2FA
  - This is a time saver, because I don't have to go to another application like
    `Microsoft Authenticator` or `Google Authenticator` to get the code, after
    doing it for a while, it gets annoying
- You can **migrate** all your passwords from your existing password manager
  - I migrated them from `dashlane` and you know what the best part is? It even
    migrated my `one-time passwords` (the ones used for 2FA), I was worried I
    would have to set all those up again
- And last but not least, the price üíµ, it's actually really affordable for the
  value it offers and the quality of the product

## I'm ahead of the game, I store my passwords in the browser
