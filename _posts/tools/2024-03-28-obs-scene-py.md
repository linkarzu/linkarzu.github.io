## Introduction

Yes, there are many different ways to control OBS, I wanted a way to be able to
control it using keyboard shortcuts. I didn't want to use dedicated hardware
like a stream deck, and I didn't want to use an app on my phone.

My macOS workflow is very keyboard centric as I use keymaps for basically
everything, so I wanted a solution that allowed me to switch scenes without even
thinking about it or looking at another device.

- For example, if I want to switch to:
  - Guest 1 screen, I type `hyper+o+1`
  - Guest 2 screen, I type `hyper+o+2`
  - Guest 3 screen, I type `hyper+o+3`
  - Starting soon screen, I type `hyper+o+s`
  - My main screen, I type `hyper+o+m`

In this video you will learn how to use the 1password CLI to store secrets that
you can query from a script so that you're not hard coding those secrets in
plaintext in your code.

I'll show you how to connect to the OBS WebSocket server using Python,
authenticate securely with a password stored in 1password, and switch scenes
with a simple CLI script. No GUI needed, no mouse, no phone app, and definitely
no stream deck.

This setup works locally, stays secure, and is fast. You'll see how to install
1password-cli, generate secret references, authorize them, and trigger scene
changes through Python.

Perfect for streamers, macOS power users, and developers who want a minimal and
secure OBS automation setup without relying on third-party tools or extra
devices.

## Pre-requisites

- I'm on macOS, if you're on Windows stuff may vary a little but it should
  remain very similar
  - Otherwise, hopefully a Windows user can help out in discord
  - If not, I would strongly recommend you to read the documentation

## OBS WebSocket

- The official WebSocket documentation can be found here:
  - [obsproject/obs-websocket](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket){:target="\_blank"}
- **`obs-websocket` is now included by default with OBS Studio 28.0.0 and
  above**
  - Notice on the image below I'm using 31.0.2
- **You can enable or disable authentication and set a password for it**
  - I will enable authentication and the script will retrieve the password from
    `1password`, but the script also works with authentication disabled. I'll
    demo how
- In OBS `Tools - WebSocket server Settings - Enable WebSocket server Settings`
- Notice port used `4455`
- `Enable Authentication` is checked
- Specify your password
- `Apply`

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
![Image](./../../assets/img/imgs/250328-obs-websocket.avif){: width="500" }
_OBS WebSocket server settings_

- In the WebSocket documentation you'll be able to find the
  `Client libraries (for developers)` section
- There are several libraries, I'm using `obsws-python` but you could use a
  different one, and create the script in `rust` or `go` for example
- In the `obsws-python` library you will find the documentation and a link to
  the
  [obs-websocket 5.x.x Protocol](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket/blob/master/docs/generated/protocol.md#requests){:target="\_blank"}
  - Here you can find all documentation of the things that can be done with the
    `obs-websocket` for now I'm just changing scenes, but you can do everything
    listed in this file:
    - Create scenes
    - Remove scenes
    - Start a recording
    - Stop a recording
    - And way much more

## 1password cli

<!-- tip=green, info=blue, warning=yellow, danger=red -->
 
> Authentication is **optional** in OBS, but I still have it enabled for security
> reasons. Otherwise:
>  - Anyone in your network can control your OBS
>  - Any malicious app or script on your computer could control it too
>  - Hopefully, you know what you're doing and port forwarding is not enabled on
>    your network, otherwise anyone on the internet could control it too.

- Will create a python script, this script will authenticate with OBS, and
  change the scene. To authenticate, the script will need the OBS password
- I will not hard-code the password in the python script, instead I'll store it
  in 1password and retrieve the password from the script using the
  `1password-cli`
- Is this necessary?
- In the image below you can find a link to the documentation for the
  `installation instructions`
  - If you're on Windows, the installation instructions may be different, make
    sure to follow the documentation
- First, we will install through brew

```bash
brew install 1password-cli
```

- After installing, we click on the `Enable Integration` button

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
![Image](./../../assets/img/imgs/250328-1password-enable.avif){: width="500" }
_1st install, then click on enable integration_

- This `Integrate with 1password CLI` option will be enabled

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
![Image](./../../assets/img/imgs/250328-1password-integrate.avif){:
width="500" } _Integrate with 1password CLI_

- Make sure it's installed

```bash
op --version
```

```bash
linkarzu.@.[25/03/28]
~
‚ùØ‚ùØ‚ùØ‚ùØ op --version
2.30.3
```

- Then we can enter `any command` to sign in, so we'll read a secret stored in
  1password
- Right click the credential and `Copy Secret Reference`

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
![Image](./../../assets/img/imgs/250328-1password-reference.avif){: width="500" }
_Get the path for a secret_

- Then let's read the secret

```bash
op read "op://helixdeeznuts/test-api-credential/credential"
```

- You have to authorize the request

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
![Image](./../../assets/img/imgs/250328-1password-authorize.avif){: width="500" }
_Authorize the request_

- And then we can see the secret

```bash
linkarzu.@.[25/03/28]
~
‚ùØ‚ùØ‚ùØ‚ùØ op read "op://helixdeeznuts/test-api-credential/credential"

## Python script

- The python script can be found in my dotfiles
  - [py/switch_scene.py](https://github.com/linkarzu/dotfiles-latest/blob/main/scripts/macos/mac/obs/scene-switcher/py/switch_scene.py){:target="\_blank"}
  - If you like my dotfiles **‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê remember to star them ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê**
- Make sure to modify the path to the secret:
  - `onepassword_secret = "op://helixdeeznuts/obs-websocket-password/credential"`
- **`starting-soon` is the name of the scene and it has to match what you see in
  OBS**
- If you have auth disabled in OBS, you can pass the `--no-auth` flag, so that
  it does not try to get the secret from `1password`

```bash
python3 ~/github/dotfiles-latest/scripts/macos/mac/obs/scene-switcher/py/switch_scene.py starting-soon
python3 ~/github/dotfiles-latest/scripts/macos/mac/obs/scene-switcher/py/switch_scene.py video-and-stream
python3 ~/github/dotfiles-latest/scripts/macos/mac/obs/scene-switcher/py/switch_scene.py guest1
python3 ~/github/dotfiles-latest/scripts/macos/mac/obs/scene-switcher/py/switch_scene.py guest2

python3 ~/github/dotfiles-latest/scripts/macos/mac/obs/scene-switcher/py/switch_scene.py starting-soon --no-auth
python3 ~/github/dotfiles-latest/scripts/macos/mac/obs/scene-switcher/py/switch_scene.py video-and-stream --no-auth
python3 ~/github/dotfiles-latest/scripts/macos/mac/obs/scene-switcher/py/switch_scene.py guest1 --no-auth
python3 ~/github/dotfiles-latest/scripts/macos/mac/obs/scene-switcher/py/switch_scene.py guest2 --no-auth
```

- When I run the script for the first time in a new machine or dir, the `.venv`
  will be created and dependencies installed automatically

```bash
linkarzu.@.[25/03/28] via üêç v3.9.6 (.venv)

## Switch using keyboard shortcuts

- As you're able to tell, executing the script every time is not practical
- I can switch scenes, it doesn't matter what app I'm on, I could be on my
  terminal or in my browser and I could switch scenes easily
- To do this in macOS I use a combination of tools, one of them is called
  karabiner-elements.
- If you want to learn in detail how I use karabiner, go and check this video
  out:
  - [karabiner-elements configuration updates 2024](https://youtu.be/dqEiDVYRWLk){:target="\_blank"}

---

- The bar on the top of the screen called `SketchyBar` automatically updates
  with the name of the scene
- If you want to learn more about SketchyBar, check this video below:

- Do you like the way my terminal looks and the CLI tools I use and all that
  stuff?

## How do you manage your passwords?

- I've tried many different password managers in the past, I've switched from
  `LastPass` to `Dashlane` and finally ended up in `1password`
- You want to find out why? More info in my article:
