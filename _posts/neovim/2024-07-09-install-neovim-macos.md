## How do you manage your passwords?

- I've tried many different password managers in the past, I've switched from
  `LastPass` to `Dashlane` and finally ended up in `1password`
- You want to find out why? More info in my article:
  - [How I use 1password to keep all my accounts safe](https://linkarzu.com/posts/1password/1password/){:target="\_blank"}

## Introduction

- In this video we cover the installation of Neovim in macOS.
- I'll cover even the basics of the basics, assuming you don't even have brew
  installed and that you have never installed neovim but want to start playing
  with it
- I already have brew and neovim installed on my machine, so in the video you'll
  see that I'll go through the whole process by remotely managing other computer
  and start from scratch

<!--
defaults write com.apple.dock autohide -bool true
killall Dock
-->

## A link to my guide will be in the video description

- So you can copy all the commands
- So you can also find all the links I share

  let me know

## Installation process

### Brew

#### What is brew?

- Brew is a package manager for macOS, if you already have it installed, skip
  this section

#### Install Xcode

- To be able to install Brew, you need the `Command Line Tools (CLT)` for Xcode
  - You don't need the entire 14GB `Xcode` app from the App Store

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

- You will see an app open in your Dock, open it and you will see:
  - _The "xcode-select" command requires the command line developer tools_
  - Click on `Install` and then `Agree`
- It will say that takes a long time (40 hours) to install, but don't worry:
  - **For my internet speed, takes like 15 min**

#### Install brew

- Go to the main page `https://brew.sh` to find the installation command

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

- At the bottom of the installation, notice in the **Next steps** section that
  you need to configure your shell for `homebrew`

```bash
echo '' >>~/.zprofile
echo '# Configure shell for brew' >>~/.zprofile
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >>~/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

- Here's the file that gets modified

```bash
cat ~/.zprofile
```

- Make sure everything's set up correctly, with the command below, you should
  see `Your system is ready to brew.`

```bash
brew doctor
```

#### Uninstall brew and Command Line Tools

- **Do not run the commands below, just leaving them here for reference**
- In case you want to uninstall the `Command Line Tools (CLT)`, the command is
  below

```bash
sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
```

- In case you want to uninstall brew

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/uninstall.sh)"
```

```bash
# Just keep in mind that this will delete the files, in case brew is used in a
# multi-user environment
sudo rm -rf /opt/homebrew/
rm ~/.zprofile
```

### Nerdfonts

- Most, if not all, neovim configs need special icons, so I will install
  nerdfonts, I'll go with:
  - [meslo-lg](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads){:target="\_blank"}
- To find this font search for `menlo` on the page
- Installation methods can be found at the **bottom** of their downloads page

```bash
brew install --cask font-meslo-lg-nerd-font
```

- To verify the fonts were installed open `Font book` app on macos and search
  for `meslo`, you will see everything listed, including the icons
- Another way of making sure the fonts were installed

```bash
brew install fontconfig
```

- I can grep for the font name

```bash
fc-list | grep -i "MesloLGM Nerd Font Mono"
```

### Neovim

- I'll follow the macOS install instructions in the
  [neovim repo](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md#homebrew-on-macos-or-linux){:target="\_blank"}

```bash
brew install neovim
```

- Then you can create a new file in neovim to test, save it with `:wq`

```bash
nvim test-file.md
```

## Compatible terminal

- If you want to have a seamless experience install a terminal that supports
  true color and undercurl
- In my specific case, I chose kitty because it also allows me to view and paste
  images in neovim
- I have a video in which I go the kitty installation process, it's here:
  - [Why I switched from Alacritty to kitty, and how to configure kitty](https://youtu.be/MZNvjclifD8){:target="\_blank"}

## Configure neovim

- After installing neovim, you'll be wondering what to do next, if to whether
  build your setup from scratch, use a neovim distribution or use my personal
  setup "neobean"
- So now, I will now show you how to install:
  - My own neovim config `neobean`, it's built on top of the lazyvim.org distro
  - The [lazyvim.org](https://www.lazyvim.org){:target="\_blank"} distro
  - [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim){:target="\_blank"}
- To learn all of this, watch the video below:
  - [Lazyvim.org or kickstart.nvim in Neovim? You should try both and I‚Äôll show you how](https://youtu.be/_WJBLC8LciQ){:target="\_blank"}
