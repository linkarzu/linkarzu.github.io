## YouTube video

{% include embed/youtube.html id='cY1KSeIkQCs' %}

## Disclaimer

- I use the [lazyvim.org](https://www.lazyvim.org){:target="\_blank"} neovim
  distribution, which comes with a lot of defaults

## Introduction

- I'll clear the confusion on what Neovide is, I didn't get it quite well until
  I installed it and I'll show it's possible benefits

## A link to my guide will be in the video description

- So you can follow along or review it later

## If you like this, and want to support me

- I create and edit my videos in an m1 mac mini, and it's starting to stay behind in the editing side of things, tends to slow me down a bit, I'd like to upgrade the machine I use for all my videos to a `mac mini` with these specs:
  - Apple M4 Pro chip with 14â€‘core CPU, 20â€‘core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine
  - 24GB unified memory
  - 1TB SSD storage
  - 10 Gigabit Ethernet
- If you want to help me reach my goal, you can [donate here](https://ko-fi.com/linkarzu/goal?g=6){:target="\_blank"}

## How do you manage your passwords?

- Do you do like my wife?
  - Use a very strong password for all your different apps? What if that
    password is compromised, will your bank accounts and email also be
    compromised?
  - You have a "system" but anyway you keep forgetting your passwords all the
    time for applications that you don't normally use and have to reset them
    often?
- Have you heard about password managers?
- I have tried several in the past, LastPass (the company I used to work for), I
  also tried Dashlane for quite some time until they increased their prices way
  too much, so decided to try 1password
- Out of all of them, I would only recommend one, and that is 1password, what
  are the things I like about it?
  - I have the app on macOS and the browser extension, so when I need to create
    a new password in a new site, I easily do it and it's stored in 1password
  - I have the app on the phone as well, so I never have to be typing any
    passwords
  - I use an apple watch, so every time I need to unlock 1password, I just
    double tap on my watch and my password is autocompleted
  - It includes a 2FA (2 factor authentication option) that allows me to use the
    same app for `one-time passwords`. So it autocompletes my password, but then
    it also automatically completes my one time password in the sites I have
    enabled 2FA
    - This is a time saver, because I don't have to go to another application
      like `Microsoft Authenticator` or `Google Authenticator` to get the code,
      after doing it for a while, it gets annoying

---

- I'm not sponsored by 1password, and I would `NOT` recommend a product I don't
  trust and use every day
- I do have an affiliate link for `1password` that means that if you get a trial
  through one of the links below, **you help me keep this blogpost free of
  google ads, which tend to be very annoying and distracting**
- if you use an `ad blocker`, the link will be detected as an ad, because
  affiliate links are usually used for ads, but if you want to double check and
  make sure that the links are safe, you can use a tool like
  [VIRUSTOTAL](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/url){:target="\_blank"} to
  inspect the links
- Here are my 2 links if you would like to copy and paste them:
  - For individuals and families

## If you want to try the configuration you're looking at

- In this video I explain how to install the lazyvim.org distro, kickstart and
  `my own config`, which is the one that you see in the video:

## Neovim vs Neovide

### What is it?

- It's a standalone app not related to your terminal application, that runs a
  Neovim GUI

### Benefits

- Smooth scrolling
- Nice cursor animations
- Blurred background when in pop ups
- It's decent with big markdown files, smoother than kitty
- Read the
  [features page for more info](https://neovide.dev/features.html){:target="\_blank"}

### How to install Neovide on macOS

- Installation instructions are on the
  [main website](https://neovide.dev/installation.html#mac){:target="\_blank"}

```bash
brew install --cask neovide
```

- After installing it, I didn't change anything, it picked up my neovim config,
  theme and everything
- Just open it

### Set command line options

- Here's where I set the `frame` to transparent, to disable the bar on top
- You can find my `config.toml` file in
  [my dotfiles](https://github.com/linkarzu/dotfiles-latest/blob/main/neovide/config.toml){:target="\_blank"}
- Make sure you create the following file and add the options there

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/neovide
vim ~/.config/neovide/config.toml
```

### Run specific options only if on Neovide

- Run this command, if you run it on your terminal you will see the variable is
  undefined
- If you run it from Neovide you will see `v:true`

```bash
:echo g:neovide
```

- This means that you can have this conditional to run some options only when
  inside `Neovide` and not your regular `Neovim` instance on the terminal

```lua
if vim.g.neovide then
  vim.keymap.set("n", "<D-s>", ":w<CR>") -- Save
  vim.keymap.set("v", "<D-c>", '"+y') -- Copy
  vim.keymap.set("n", "<D-v>", '"+P') -- Paste normal mode
  vim.keymap.set("v", "<D-v>", '"+P') -- Paste visual mode
  vim.keymap.set("c", "<D-v>", "<C-R>+") -- Paste command mode
  vim.keymap.set("i", "<D-v>", '<ESC>l"+Pli') -- Paste insert mode
end
```

- This is how I configure configure all my Neovide options in the
  `~/github/dotfiles-latest/neovim/neobean/lua/config/options.lua` file

### Fix paste issue macOS

- You won't be able to paste text in Neovide, more info on
  [the FAQ](https://neovide.dev/faq.html#how-can-i-use-cmd-ccmd-v-to-copy-and-paste){:target="\_blank"}
- This is fixed by adding the following, in my case to my
  `~/github/dotfiles-latest/neovim/neobean/lua/config/options.lua` file

```lua
if vim.g.neovide then
  vim.keymap.set("n", "<D-s>", ":w<CR>") -- Save
  vim.keymap.set("v", "<D-c>", '"+y') -- Copy
  vim.keymap.set("n", "<D-v>", '"+P') -- Paste normal mode
  vim.keymap.set("v", "<D-v>", '"+P') -- Paste visual mode
  vim.keymap.set("c", "<D-v>", "<C-R>+") -- Paste command mode
  vim.keymap.set("i", "<D-v>", '<ESC>l"+Pli') -- Paste insert mode
end

-- Allow clipboard copy paste in neovim
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("", "<D-v>", "+p<CR>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("!", "<D-v>", "<C-R>+", { noremap = true, silent = true })
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("t", "<D-v>", "<C-R>+", { noremap = true, silent = true })
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("v", "<D-v>", "<C-R>+", { noremap = true, silent = true })

```

### Get variable values

- The variables for all the different options can be found in the
  [configuration page](https://neovide.dev/configuration.html){:target="\_blank"}
- If for example you want to know the value of the
  `vim.g.neovide_cursor_animation_length` variable just run

```bash
echo neovide_cursor_animation_length

# or

echo g:neovide_cursor_animation_length
```

### Issues

- Cannot view and paste images in neovim, the same way I can with kitty, but
  that's because kitty has image support
