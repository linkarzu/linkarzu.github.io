## YouTube video

{% include embed/youtube.html id='_WJBLC8LciQ' %}

## Disclaimer

- I use `macOS`, so keep that in mind

## Introduction

- This comes from my video:
  - [Lazyvim or kickstart in Neovim?](https://youtu.be/_WJBLC8LciQ){:target="\_blank"}
- It's a shorter version that focuses only in showing you to to install multiple
  Neovim distributions or versions
- If you want to understand what distro to use, go and watch that video
- In this video we will use the `$NVIM_APPNAME` environment variable which
  controls the sub-directory that neovim will read from

## A link to my guide will be in the video description

- So you can copy all the commands
- So you can also find all the links I share

## Installation requirements

- Make sure you have these 3 installed:
  - `brew`
  - `neovim`
  - `kitty` (or any other terminal with true colors and undercurl)
- If you don't:
  - To install `neovim` watch this video:
    - [How to install neovim on macos](https://youtu.be/un7DhE71EeY){:target="\_blank"}
  - To install and configure `kitty` watch this video:
    - [Why I switched from Alacritty to kitty, and how to configure kitty](https://youtu.be/MZNvjclifD8){:target="\_blank"}

## Installation options

### Which one do I choose?

- In this guide you will have 3 options:
  - **CHOOSE ONLY 1**
- The first 2 options make reference to my dotfiles, so you can get all the
  different neovim setup options from a single place

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

### Option 1: Download my `neovim` dir

#### Why should I download the dir?

- This is the preferred method if you already have your dotfiles and just want
  to grab my neovim dir
- You will need a `github account` for this, if you don't have one, set it up

<!-- markdownlint-disable -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
 
<!-- tip=green, info=blue, warning=yellow, danger=red -->
 
> Remember that you only have to follow `1` of the 3 install methods
{: .prompt-info }
 
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

#### Download from github

- First let's create the directory where all the new files will live
  - If instead you already have your own dotfiles dir, you know what you're
    doing so download it there

```bash
# This is where the downloaded neovim files will live
#
# If you have your dotfiles in a different directory, specify that below instead
# of "github/linkarzu-dots"
my_working_directory="$HOME/github/linkarzu-dots"

# This creates the dir and switches to it
# if the dir already exists, nothing happens
mkdir -p $my_working_directory
cd $my_working_directory

# This is where the different neovim configs will live, so create this dir
mkdir -p ~/.config
```

- **Do the following in Google Chrome**
  - I tried safari and the download does not work
- Sign in to your github account
- Go to my
  [dotfiles-latest repo](https://github.com/linkarzu/dotfiles-latest){:target="\_blank"}
  - **Star it ðŸ˜‰**
- Once there, press `.` (dot)
  - Or instead you can switch the `github.com` to `github.dev` on the top to go
    to the
- Right click on the `neovim` directory and download it to the
  `github/linkarzu-dots` directory we created above
  - If instead you already have your own dotfiles dir, you know what you're
    doing so download it there

#### Update .zshrc file

- First open the file

```bash
# I'm using vim to edit the file here, but use whichever text editor you want
# If the file already exists, its timestamp will be updated, but the existing
# content won't be affected by the 'touch' command below
touch ~/.zshrc
vim ~/.zshrc
```

- Then add this to the bottom of the file
  - **If you changed $my_working_directory above, update it here as well**

```bash
###############################################################################
#                     Set the same variable here again
###############################################################################
my_working_directory="$HOME/github/linkarzu-dots"

# Symlinks section:
# These below are symbolic links (shortcuts) that point to the files we
# downloaded to $my_working_directory
#
# You can keep adding more distributions here if you want
ln -snf $my_working_directory/neovim/neobean ~/.config/neobean >/dev/null 2>&1
ln -snf $my_working_directory/neovim/kickstart.nvim ~/.config/kickstart.nvim >/dev/null 2>&1
ln -snf $my_working_directory/neovim/lazyvim ~/.config/lazyvim >/dev/null 2>&1
# Notice I also have the "nvim" directory below and I have it pointing to my
# "neobean" config.
# If I don't do this, my daily note with hyper+t+r won't work
# If you want to open the daily note with a different distro, update the "nvim"
# symlink, for example you can change it from "neobean" to "lazyvim"
# If you don't understand what hyper+t+r means go and watch my markdown workflow video
# https://youtu.be/c0cuvzK1SDo
ln -snf $my_working_directory/neovim/neobean/ ~/.config/nvim >/dev/null 2>&1

# You can use NVIM_APPNAME=nvim-NAME to maintain multiple configurations.
#
# NVIM_APPNAME is the name of the directory inside ~/.config
# For example, you can install the kickstart configuration
# in ~/.config/nvim-kickstart, the NVIM_APPNAME would be "nvim-kickstart"
#
# In my case, the neovim directories inside ~/.config/ are symlinks that point
# to their respective neovim directories stored in my $my_working_directory
#
# Notice that both "v" and "nvim" start "neobean"
# "vk" opens kickstart and "vl" opens lazyvim
alias v='export NVIM_APPNAME="neobean" && /opt/homebrew/bin/nvim'
alias vk='export NVIM_APPNAME="kickstart.nvim" && /opt/homebrew/bin/nvim'
alias vl='export NVIM_APPNAME="lazyvim" && /opt/homebrew/bin/nvim'
# I'm also leaving this "nvim" alias, which points to the "nvim" APPNAME, but
# that APPNAME in fact points to my "neobean" config in the symlinks section
# If I don't do this, my daily note doesn't work
#
# If you want to open the daily note with a different distro, update the "nvim"
# symlink in the symlinks section
#
# If you don't understand what I mean by "daily note" go and watch my daily
# note video
# https://youtu.be/W3hgsMoUcqo
alias nvim='export NVIM_APPNAME="nvim" && /opt/homebrew/bin/nvim'
```

- Save the changes with `:wq` and then apply them with

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

#### Open kickstart to test

- You can now open either of the 3 neovim versions we installed with `v`, `vk`
  or `vl`

```bash
# For testing, I'll open the init.lua file using kickstart
# If you changed $my_working_directory above, make sure you specify the correct directory
vk ~/github/linkarzu-dots/neovim/kickstart.nvim/init.lua
```

- To confirm you're running kickstart run `:checkhealth` and should see:

```bash
kickstart: require("kickstart.health").check()
```

### Option 2: Clone my dotfiles-latest repo

#### Why should I clone?

<!-- markdownlint-disable -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
 
<!-- tip=green, info=blue, warning=yellow, danger=red -->
 
> Remember that you only have to follow `1` of the 3 install methods
{: .prompt-info }
 
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

- This method is going to clone all my dotfiles, this includes my configuration
  for:
  - `alacritty`
  - `kitty`
  - `bashrc`
  - `zshrc`
  - `vimrc`
  - `tmux`
  - `yabai`
  - `karabiner-elements`
  - `sketchybar`
  - `hammerspoon`
  - `neovim`

<!-- markdownlint-disable -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<!-- tip=green, info=blue, warning=yellow, danger=red -->

> This means that if you had existing configurations for the tools listed above,
  a backup will be created, and their configuration will be replaced with the
  configuration in my dotfiles
{: .prompt-danger }

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

- If you don't even have those tools installed or don't know what they are,
  don't worry, you should expect no issues
- If some day you decide to install those tools, they will be pointing to my
  configuration files, therefore using my configs
- If you want to learn more of what happens in the background and also learn
  more about dotfiles, watch this video
  - [04 - What are dotfiles and how to clone them](https://youtube.com/watch?v=XBjfzySpGdE){:target="\_blank"}
  - In this video I also show you how to `fork` the repo to have your own copy
    to make your own changes, in case you want to re-upload it back to github

#### How to clone

- This will download my repo in GitHub and save it in your local machine

```bash
# If the github dir already exists, no issues, you can still run the command
mkdir -p ~/github
cd ~/github/
git clone https://github.com/linkarzu/dotfiles-latest.git
```

- This will backup your existing `~/.zshrc` file and point to my downloaded
  config

```bash
# Create a backup of your existing ~/.zshrc file
# If the original ~/.zshrc file does not exist, nothing will happen
#
# If you want to restore your configuration to your old zshrc file, just delete
# mine and rename the backup one to '.zshrc'
cp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S) >/dev/null 2>&1

# Create the symlink to point .zshrc to the file in my dotfiles-latest repo
ln -snf ~/github/dotfiles-latest/zshrc/zshrc-file.sh ~/.zshrc

source ~/.zshrc
```

- Every time you open your terminal, my configuration, by default will pull the
  latest changes from my repository
- If you don't want that to happen, make sure you edit the `~/.zshrc` file

```bash
vim ~/.zshrc
```

- And comment the 3 lines inside the:
  - `DISABLE AUTO-PULL SECTION`

#### Test with kickstart

- You can now open either of the 3 neovim versions we installed with `v`, `vk`
  or `vl`

```bash
# For testing, I'll open the init.lua file using kickstart
# If you changed $my_working_directory above, make sure you specify the correct directory
vk ~/github/dotfiles-latest/neovim/kickstart.nvim/init.lua
```

- To confirm you're running kickstart run `:checkhealth` and should see:

```bash
kickstart: require("kickstart.health").check()
```

### Option 3: Manually go to each repo and download it

- Here you don't use my dotfiles at all, but instead go to the lazyvim.org page,
  and follow the instructions to install it, and do the same with kickstart

## How to add new distros

### Adding NvChad

- Go to the
  [NvChad website](https://nvchad.com/docs/quickstart/install/){:target="\_blank"}
  for the installation instructions
- It will instruct you to install with this command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NvChad/starter ~/.config/nvim && nvim
```

- I don't want to do that, as it will replace my `~/.config/nvim` configuration
- Instead I want to download NvChad to my dotfiles, then create a symlink and
  configure the `NVIM_APPNAME` as we did before

## First time setup

### LazyVim or neobean

- The very first time you open either the LazyVim distro or my personal
  `neobean` setup, they will probably start installing packages on their own,
  close neovim and re-open it several times until it has installed everything
- Then type `:Lazy` (or `<leader>l`) and uppercase `U` to perform any updates
- Then run the command `:checkhealth`
  - Go through the list, look for **ERRORS**
    - We will fix those later on
  - You will see **WARNINGS**, mainly for languages, if you don't program in
    those languages, don't worry about those warnings
  - In my specif scenario, there will be the error:

```bash
- $TERM: xterm-kitty
- ERROR $TERM should be "screen-256color" or "tmux-256color" in tmux. Colors might look wrong.
  - ADVICE:
    - Set default-terminal in ~/.tmux.conf:
      set-option -g default-terminal "screen-256color"
    - https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/BUILD.md#building
```

- I will ignore this error on purpose, because I have my term set to
  `xterm-kitty` for the undercurl to work with spell checking
- If you want to know more about how I set up spell checking and my entire
  markdown workflow, check out this video:
  - [My complete Neovim markdown setup and workflow in 2024](https://youtu.be/c0cuvzK1SDo){:target="\_blank"}

### kickstart.nvim

- For kickstart, you need to open the `init.lua` file and go from there

```bash
# I'll open the init.lua file using kickstart

# Use this if you followed option 1
# Just make sure you specify the correct directory
vk ~/github/linkarzu-dots/neovim/kickstart.nvim/init.lua

# Use this if you followed option 2
vk ~/github/dotfiles-latest/neovim/kickstart.nvim/init.lua
```

## Install Dependencies

- You usually install these before installing neovim, but I'm doing it
  afterwards so you can see the dependencies that were missing

```bash
# You can find these in the :checkhealth command
brew install git
brew install ripgrep
brew install fd
brew install wget

# This is optional, gives us an easier way to work with github repositories,
# basically a intuitive UI to push and pull changes
brew install jesseduffield/lazygit/lazygit

# In case you want to install node
brew install node
```

## How to get your feet wet?

- Start by taking notes in neovim, I mean editing markdown files
- This file I'm editing right now for my blog post is markdown
- If you use Obsidian, try switching the editing of your notes to Neovim
- I have a video in which I go over my markdown workflow, so I highly recommend
  you check it out:
  - [My complete Neovim markdown setup and workflow in 2024](https://youtu.be/c0cuvzK1SDo){:target="\_blank"}
- If you experience any errors or have any issues, let me know down in the
  comments and me or others can try to help

## What do you want to see next?

- Let me know down in the comments:
  - You want to go over kickstart.nvim?
  - Explain something about my configuration?
