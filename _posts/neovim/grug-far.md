## How do you manage your passwords?

- I've tried many different password managers in the past, I've switched from
  `LastPass` to `Dashlane` and finally ended up in `1password`
- You want to find out why? More info in my article:
  - [How I use 1password to keep all my accounts safe](https://linkarzu.com/posts/1password/1password/){:target="\_blank"}

## Multiline search and replace

- I used to do this by hand, fuck that man

## Open links in new tab

- I needed to add `{:target="\_blank"}` at the end of each of my links
- Demo in video

```bash
\[(.*?)\]\((http[s]?:\/\/.*?)\)(?:[^{]|$)
[$1]($2){:target="_blank"}
```

## Add a line at the end of every file

```regex
RIPGREP
(\n|.)*
return match .. "\n<!-- very end of the file -->"
--multiline
\x (lua interpreter)
```

## Replace only certain items

- Sometimes your search includes multiple results, but you need to leave some of
  them out
- that's when you use `\s` ( Sync all )
  - `Sync All` does **not** work with multiline replacement
  - `ast-grep` only supports `\r` ( Replace )

## Replace only certain files in a sub path

- Use this in the `Files Filter:` filter
- The `Paths:` filter only accepts fixed paths
- The `Files Filter` uses
  [gitignore syntax](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore){:target="\_blank"}

```regex
_posts/**/*
or
_posts/*.md
```

## Search only current file

- Look at the
  [cookbook](https://github.com/MagicDuck/grug-far.nvim?tab=readme-ov-file#-cookbook){:target="\_blank"}
- You can (and should) create a keymap for the ones you need

```bash
:lua require('grug-far').open({ prefills = { paths = vim.fn.expand("%") } })
```

## ast-grep

- ast-grep understand your codes, that's all I fucking now
- [Their page](https://ast-grep.github.io/){:target="\_blank"}
- **_"It is like syntax-aware grep/sed! You can write code patterns to locate
  and modify code, based on AST, in thousands of files, interactively."_**

---

- Old way of me achieving this

```bash
colors\["(linkarzu_color\d+)"\]
"$1"
```

- But with Astgrep

```bash
colors[$A]
$A
\e (switch engine to astgrep)
```

- Make sure you have ast-grep installed
- [Installation instructions](https://ast-grep.github.io/guide/quick-start.html#installation){:target="\_blank"}

```bash
brew install ast-grep
```

---

- Another example provided by maintainer
- By mistake added `/` and now I need to replace it with `.` inside a `require`

```bash
require($A)
return 'require(' .. vars.A:gsub('/', '.') .. ')'
*sample.lua
\x (lua interpreter)
\e (switch engine to astgrep)
```

## Exclude files

- I wanted to exclude 2 files from the replace, so added each file in a separate
  line under `Files Filter:`
  - !wezterm.lua
  - !eldritch.lua
- But remember that it may be easier to treat the search results like a buffer,
  delete what you don't want, and then replace

## I don't remember a flag or command

- Just type --help in the `Flags` field, you'll find all the docs and search
- Also for help type `g?`

## Get the ripgrep command for a search

- `<localleader>p`
