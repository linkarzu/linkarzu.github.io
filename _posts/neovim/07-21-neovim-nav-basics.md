## Disclaimer

- I use the [lazyvim.org](https://www.lazyvim.org){:target="\_blank"} neovim
  distribution, which comes with a lot of defaults
- If you're confused on to whether use a distro, kickstart or you don't even
  understand what I'm talking about, I have this video:
  - [Lazyvim or kickstart in Neovim? You should try both and Iâ€™ll show you how](https://youtu.be/_WJBLC8LciQ){:target="\_blank"}

## Introduction

- There are thousands of different ways to navigate and edit text in neovim, I
  don't want to overwhelm you with every single option because:
  1. I'm not even remotely close to know them all
  2. Even if I did, you won't remember them all at the beginning
  3. Start with these few suggestions and keep adding new stuff later on

## A link to my guide will be in the video description

- So you can follow along or review it later

## Vim modes

### Normal mode

<!-- markdownlint-disable -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
 
<!-- tip=green, info=blue, warning=yellow, danger=red -->
 
> This mode allows you to navigate and perform different actions
{: .prompt-info }
 
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

#### Get to normal mode

- The way I get to normal mode:
  - When I'm editing text (insert mode) and I want to go to normal mode, I have
    a keymap:
    - `kj`
    - This is a combination of letters you almost never have to type, so that's
      why it works great
      - Some people prefer `jj`, `kk` or `jk`.

---

- The traditional way:
  - `[esc]`
    - I re-mapped `escape` to `capslock` because it's easier to press
  - `ctrl-[`

#### Normal mode navigation

##### Basic navigation

- In Vim, instead of navigating with the arrow keys (which you also can, but not
  recommended), you navigate with `hjkl`
- It'll be tough to get used to, but once you do, you won't have to lift your
  hand to look for the arrow keys, and it'll be faster:
  - `j` - move cursor down by one line.
  - `k` - move cursor up by one line.
  - `h` - move cursor left by one character.
  - `l` - move cursor right by one character.

##### My top picks for navigating

- `w` - moves to the **start** of the next word (stops at symbols)
- `e` - moves to the **end** of the next word (stops at symbols)
- `b` - moves to the beginning of the previous word (stops at symbols)
- `C-u` - (ctrl+u) moves up half page
- `C-d` - (ctrl+d) moves down half page
- `gg` - go to the top of the file
- `G` - go to the end of the file
- `50gg` - go to line 50
- `''` - (single quote 2 times) jump back to the position of the cursor before
  the last jump
  - Let's say you're in line 150, and press `gg` to go to the top of the file,
    but then want to jump back again to line 150, you press `''`
  - Let's say you're in line 150, and press `50gg` to jump to line 50, but then
    want to jump back again to line 150, you press `''`

---

- These are custom keymaps I configured:
  - `gh` - takes you to the first character of the line
  - `gl` - takes you to the last character of the line
  - `gj` - takes me to the markdown header below
  - `gk` - takes me to the markdown header above

#### Normal mode text manipulation

##### My top picks for manipulating

###### Undo and redo

- `u` - undo (press multiple times to keep undoing)
- `ctrl-r` - redo (press multiple times to keep redoing)
- `.` - repeats the last entered command, and leaves you in command mode:
  - Let's say you pressed `dw` or `db` then keep pressing `.` to execute them
    multiple times

###### Indent

- `S->>` - (shift+>+>) indent line to the right
- `S-<<` - (shift+<+<) indent line to the left

###### Delete, cut, copy and paste

- Text copied to the registry(clipboard) stays there until replaced with
  something else, which means it can be pasted multiple times
  - **delete = cut**
  - **yank = copy**
  - **put = paste**
- `d` and `x` cuts text but also copies it to the clipboard
- `yw` - yank word
- `yy` - copies an entire line
- `P` - paste before the cursor (or above if its a line)
- `p` - paste after the cursor (or below if its a line)
- `x` - deletes the character the cursor is on (leave pressed, same as `supr`)
- `dd` - deletes entire line
- `dw` - delete word starting **from** cursor position (stops at symbols)
- `db` - deletes to the beginning of previous word (stops at symbols)
  - Useful when navigating with `w` and then press `db`
- `D` - deletes until end of line, starting at cursor

---

- These is a custom keymap I configured:
  - `Y` - yank to end of line starting from cursor

###### Change, replace, join

- `cw` - change word starting at the cursor, leaves you in insert mode
- `r` - replace a **single** character and automatically puts you back in
  **normal mode**
- `J` - joins 2 lines together. Keep pressing it to join more lines, adds a
  space

```bash
Here I am adding some text to show you how to join lines when they are separate,

I will be pressing the keys shown above to test this, this text is just random

stuff, so do not pay attention to it
```

###### Around inside

<!-- markdownlint-disable -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
 
<!-- tip=green, info=blue, warning=yellow, danger=red -->
 
> - All the following motions work with `d`, `y`, `c`, `v`
- So for example you could run `dap`, `yap`, `cap`, `vap` 
- I know, it seems there should be a `fap`, but there's not
{: .prompt-info }
 
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

- `a` stands for **around**, deletes spaces around
- `i` stands for **inside**, does NOT delete spaces around
  - `dip` - delete inside paragraph
  - `yip` - yank inside paragraph
  - `cip` - change inside paragraph
  - `vip` - select inside paragraph

---

- Remember that instead of `d` below, you can switch it for `y`, `c` or `v`
- `caw` or `ciw` - for a word, doesn't matter if you're in the middle
- `ca"` or `ci"` - for "text in double quotes"
- `ca'` or `ci'` - for 'text in single quotes'
- `ca`` or`ci``- for `text in backtick quotes`
- `ca(` or `ci(` - for (text in parentheses)
- `ca{` or `ci{` - for {text in curly braces}
- `ca[` or `ci[` - for [text in square brackets]
- `cap` or `cip` - for paragraphs

- The following 2 work with the
  [echasnovski/mini.ai](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.ai){:target="\_blank"}
  plugin
  - `cio` or `cao` - for text inside a blog
    - **I use code blocks a lot, so this is my favorite of all times**
  - `cit` or `cat` - for tags <div>text inside an html tag</div>
  - This plugin can do way much more

```bash
- first paragraph
- first paragraph
- first paragraph
```

```bash
- second paragraph
- second paragraph
- second paragraph
```

<!-- markdownlint-disable -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
 
<!-- tip=green, info=blue, warning=yellow, danger=red -->
 
> There's a lot more of these motions, if in lazyvim press `ci` to list them
{: .prompt-info }
 
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

###### Til find

<!-- markdownlint-disable -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
 
<!-- tip=green, info=blue, warning=yellow, danger=red -->
 
> - All the following motions work with `d`, `y`, `c`, `v`
- So for example you could run `dt[`, `yt7`, `ct7`, `vt7` 
{: .prompt-info }
 
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

- Instead of `[` type any character you want to find:
  - `ct7`, `ct{`, `ct7`, etc
- `ct[` - change til [beginning of square bracket]:
  - will delete everything from your cursor until the character 7
  - **it doesn't delete the `[` itself**
- `cf[` - change find [beginning of square bracket]
  - similar to above but will delete the `[`

### Insert mode

<!-- markdownlint-disable -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
 
<!-- tip=green, info=blue, warning=yellow, danger=red -->
 
> This mode allows you to edit text as you do regularly in any editor
{: .prompt-info }
 
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

#### Get to insert mode

- To enter insert mode there are several options, here are some useful ones:
- `i` - "insert" text **before** the cursor position.
- `a` - "append" text **after** the cursor position.
- `I` - "insert" text at the **beginning** of the line.
- `A` - "append" text at the **end** of the line.
- `o` - "open" a new line below the cursor and enter insert mode.
- `O` - "open" a new line above the cursor and enter insert mode.
- `gi` - takes you back to the last position you were in insert mode

### Command line mode

- `command line` - Enter commands: save, quit, search, checkhealth, etc You
  normally enter command mode when you need to enter Vim commands.
- `:` - takes you to "line" mode when you're in normal mode

### Visual mode

<!-- markdownlint-disable -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
 
<!-- tip=green, info=blue, warning=yellow, danger=red -->
 
> This mode allows you to visually select text, to then manipulate it
{: .prompt-info }
 
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

#### Visual mode navigation

- `v` - enter visual mode and then move with any navigation option:
  - Using the `hjkl` keys
  - `vgl` - select to the end of the line (`gl` is a custom mapping I have)
  - `vgh` - select to the start of the line (`gh` is a custom mapping I have)
  - `vw` - select word, keep pressing `w` to keep selecting words
  - Basically use any normal navigation commands when in visual mode

---

- Once you have the text you need select it you can delete it `d`, change it
  `c`, yank it `y`, or paste over it `P`
- When pasting text over in visual mode **I personally paste with `P`**:
  - `P` - does **not** put the REPLACED text in the unnamed `""` register:
    - This means that if you paste multiple times, you will paste the original
      text
  - `p` - puts the REPLACED text in the unnamed `""` register:
    - This means that if you paste again, you will paste the text that was
      replaced
- Do not paste with `cmd+v` on macOS or it will mess up the lines you have below

```bash
Laborum aute multiple means text.
Laborum aute multiple means text.

liquip non aliquip exercitation pariatur
liquip non aliquip exercitation pariatur

do eu pariatur minim.
do eu pariatur minim.
```

---

- `V` - selects entire line
- `gv` - takes you to the last selection you had in visual mode
- `vig` - Select the entire file
- `ctrl-v` - vertical visual mode

#### Some vertical visual mode tips

- Append the same part of text to the end of every line
  - `ctrl-v`
  - Scroll vertically to select the desired lines
  - `$` - to move to the very end of every line
  - `A` - lowercase A to append
  - Type the desired text, you will see it only in 1 line
  - `[escape]` or `kj` - and text shows in all the lines

```bash
- testing line 1
- testing random 2
- testing whatever 3
- testing other line 4
- testing one new extra line 5
```

---

- Insert the same text at the beginning of each line
  - `ctrl-v` and scroll vertically to select all the lines
  - `0` - **OPTIONAL** in case you're not at the beginning of the line already
  - `I` - uppercase I to insert
  - Type the desired text, you will see it only in 1 line
  - `[escape]` or `kj` - and text shows in all the lines

```bash
testing line 1
testing random 2
testing whatever 3
testing other line 4
testing one new extra line 5
```

---

- Replace the same text at the beginning of each line
  - `ctrl-v` and scroll vertically to select all the lines
  - `$` - to move to the very end of every line
  - `c` - c to change
  - All the selected text will be deleted and you'll stay in insert mode
  - Type the desired text, you will see it only in 1 line
  - `[escape]` - and text shows in all the lines

Indent a single line

- `>>` - indents a single line to the right

Indent all the lines

- `V` linewise visual mode and scroll vertically to select all the lines
- `>` - indents to the right
- `<` - indents to the left

## Quit and save

- The way I do it as of today July 21st 2024:
  - I use the [lazyvim.org](https://www.lazyvim.org){:target="\_blank"} distro,
    I have [autosave enabled](https://youtu.be/W5fjlU4tSpw){:target="\_blank"},
    so I don't worry about saving and to quit I just press `<leader>qq`

---

- The traditional way:
  - To write and quit:
    - `:wq`
    - `ZZ` - shift-Z-Z (the Z's are uppercase)
  - To quit without saving
    - `:q!`
    - `ZQ` - shift-Z-Q (uppercase too)
  - To just save, or just quit
    - `:q` - quit if you havenâ€™t made any changes
    - `:w` - save without quitting

## Search, find replace

This is useful if you open a file with Vim, and need to search for a specific
word

- `/unicorn[enter]` - searches **forward** for the word "unicorn"
  - `n` - keep searching the same word **forward**
  - `N` - keep searching the same word **backward**
- `?unicorn[enter]` - searches **backward** for the word "unicorn"
  - `n` - keep searching the same word **backward**
  - `N` - keep searching the same word **forward**

## Documentation

- `:help` - opens the documentation when inside vim
  - `:h` - a shortcut that does the same thing
- `:q` - quit the help menu

---

This is by no means a complete Vim guide, as more advanced topics are not
covered. But I think it's enough to get you started and interested in your
journey to continue learning about Vim.
