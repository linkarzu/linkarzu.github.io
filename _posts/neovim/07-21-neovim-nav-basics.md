## Disclaimer

- I use the [lazyvim.org](https://www.lazyvim.org){:target="\_blank"} neovim
  distribution, which comes with a lot of defaults
- If you're confused on to whether use a distro, kickstart or you don't even
  understand what I'm talking about, I have this video:
  - [Lazyvim or kickstart in Neovim? You should try both and Iâ€™ll show you how](https://youtu.be/_WJBLC8LciQ){:target="\_blank"}

## Introduction

- There are thousands of different ways to navigate and edit text in neovim, I
  don't want to overwhelm you with every single option because:
  1. I'm not even remotely close to know them all
  2. Even if I did, you won't remember them all at the beginning
  3. Start with these few suggestions and keep adding new stuff later on

## A link to my guide will be in the video description

- So you can follow along or review it later

## Vim modes

### Normal mode

#### Get to normal mode

- The way I get to normal mode:
  - When I'm editing text (insert mode) and I want to go to normal mode, I have
    a keymap:
    - `kj`
    - This is a combination of letters you almost never have to type, so that's
      why it works great
      - Some people prefer `jj`, `kk` or `jk`.

---

- The traditional way:
  - `ctrl-[`
  - `[esc]`

#### Normal mode navigation

##### Basic navigation

- In Vim, instead of navigating with the arrow keys (which you also can, but not
  recommended), you navigate with `hjkl`
- It'll be tough to get used to, but once you do, you won't have to lift your
  hand to look for the arrow keys, and it'll be faster:
  - `j` - move cursor down by one line.
  - `k` - move cursor up by one line.
  - `h` - move cursor left by one character.
  - `l` - move cursor right by one character.

##### My top picks for navigating

- `w` - moves to the **start** of the next word (stops at symbols)
- `e` - moves to the **end** of the next word (stops at symbols)
- `b` - moves to the beginning of the previous word (stops at symbols)
- `C-u` - (ctrl+u) moves up half page
- `C-d` - (ctrl+d) moves down half page
- `gg` - go to the top of the file
- `G` - go to the end of the file
- `50gg` - go to line 50
- `''` - (single quote 2 times) jump back to the position of the cursor before
  the last jump
  - Let's say you're in line 150, and press `gg` to go to the top of the file,
    but then want to jump back again to line 150, you press `''`
  - Let's say you're in line 150, and press `50gg` to jump to line 50, but then
    want to jump back again to line 150, you press `''`

---

- These are custom keymaps I configured:
  - `gh` - takes you to the first character of the line
  - `gl` - takes you to the last character of the line
  - `gj` - takes me to the markdown header below
  - `gk` - takes me to the markdown header above

##### Other "useful" navigation options

- **Don't worry about these to much at first, learn them later on, honestly, I
  rarely use them but it's good to know them**
- `W` - moves to next word (stops at spaces)
- `B` - moves backward a word (stops at spaces)
- `}` takes you to the next blank line
- `{` brings you back to the previous blank line
- `ctrl-f` - go page forward
- `ctrl-b` - go page backward
- `^` - takes you to the first character of the line
- `$` - takes you to the last character of the line
- `0` - takes you to the very beginning of a line
- `z[enter]` - moves the current cursor line to the top of the screen
  - I always keep my cursor in the middle of the screen using a plugin
- `11gg` - go to line 11

#### Normal mode text manipulation

##### My top picks for manipulating

###### Undo and redo

- `u` - undo (press multiple times to keep undoing)
- `ctrl-r` - redo (press multiple times to keep redoing)

###### Indent

- `S->>` - (shift+>+>) indent line to the right
- `S-<<` - (shift+<+<) indent line to the left

###### Delete text

- `d` and `x` cuts text but also copies it to the clipboard
- `x` - deletes the character the cursor is on (leave pressed, same as **supr**)
- `dd` - deletes entire line
- `dw` - delete word starting **from** and including cursor position (stops at
  symbols)
- `db` - deletes to the beginning of the previous word (stops at symbols)
- `D` - deletes until end of line, starting at cursor
- `dip` - delete inside paragraph (leaves lines around)
- `dap` - delete around paragraph (removes lines around)
- The following 2 work with the
  [echasnovski/mini.ai](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.ai){:target="\_blank"}
  plugin
  - `dio` - delete inside block
  - `dao` - delete around block

```bash
- first paragraph
- first paragraph
- first paragraph
```

```bash
- second paragraph
- second paragraph
- second paragraph
```

---

- **Other useful options worth knowing but don't worry about these too much for
  now**
- `X` - deletes the character to the left of the cursor (leave pressed, same as
- `d$` - deletes to the end of the line starting at the cursor
- `d^` - deletes to the beginning of the line starting at the cursor
- `5dw` - deletes 5 words
  - `d5w` - same thing, but easier to remember (delete 5 words)
- `3dd` - deletes 3 lines including the one where the cursor is on
  - `d3d` - the same thing, deletes 3 lines

###### Cut, copy and paste

- Text copied to the registry(clipboard) stays there until replaced with
  something else, which means it can be pasted multiple times
  - **delete = cut**
  - **yank = copy**
  - **put = paste**
- `P` - paste before the cursor (or above if its a line)
- `p` - paste after the cursor (or below if its a line)
  - `ddp` - cuts a line and pastes it below
  - `xp` - cuts character and pastes it **after** the cursor
- `P` - paste before (or above) the cursor
  - `ddP` - cuts a line and pastes it above
  - `xP` - cuts character and pastes it **before** the cursor
- `yw` - yank (copy) word
  - `y2w` - yank 2 words
  - `2yw` - yank 2 words
- `yy` - copies an entire line
  - `yyp` - copies the entire line and pastes it below
- `y4y` - yank for lines
  - `4yy` - same thing

###### Change, replace, join

- `cw` - change word starting at the cursor (stops at symbol)
  - `cW` - change word starting at cursor (stops at space)
- `r` - replace a **single** character and automatically puts you back in
  **normal mode**
- `R` - replace the text starting with the cursor (you will see REPLACE at the
  bottom)
- `J` - joins 2 lines together. Keep pressing it to join more lines, adds a
  space
  - `gJ` - joins 2 lines together but without adding a space
  - `3J` - joins 3 lines together

### Insert mode

- `insert` - Add or edit text as you do regularly in any editor To enter insert
  mode there are several options, here are some useful ones:
- `i` - insert text before the cursor position.
- `I` - insert text at the **beginning** of the line.
  - this is the same as `^i`
- `a` - append text **after** the cursor position.
- `A` - append text at the **end** of the line.
  - this is the same as `$a`
- `o` - open a new line below the cursor and enter insert mode.
- `O` - open a new line above the cursor and enter insert mode.
- `s` - substitute the character under the cursor and enter insert mode.
- `S` - substitute the entire line and enter insert mode.

### Command line mode

- `command line` - Enter commands: save, quit, search, checkhealth, etc You
  normally enter command mode when you need to enter Vim commands.
- `:` - takes you to "line" mode when you're in normal mode

### Visual mode

- `visual` - Select text

## Quit and save

- The way I do it as of today July 21st 2024:
  - I use the [lazyvim.org](https://www.lazyvim.org){:target="\_blank"} distro,
    I have [autosave enabled](https://youtu.be/W5fjlU4tSpw){:target="\_blank"},
    so I don't worry about saving and to quit I just press `<leader>qq`

---

- The traditional way:
  - To write and quit:
    - `:wq`
    - `ZZ` - shift-Z-Z (the Z's are uppercase)
  - To quit without saving
    - `:q!`
    - `ZQ` - shift-Z-Q (uppercase too)
  - To just save, or just quit
    - `:q` - quit if you havenâ€™t made any changes
    - `:w` - save without quitting

## Search, find replace

This is useful if you open a file with Vim, and need to search for a specific
word

- `/unicorn[enter]` - searches **forward** for the word "unicorn"
  - `n` - keep searching the same word **forward**
  - `N` - keep searching the same word **backward**
- `?unicorn[enter]` - searches **backward** for the word "unicorn"
  - `n` - keep searching the same word **backward**
  - `N` - keep searching the same word **forward**

## Documentation

- `:help` - opens the documentation when inside vim
  - `:h` - a shortcut that does the same thing
- `:q` - quit the help menu

This is by no means a complete Vim guide, as more advanced topics are not
covered. But I think it's enough to get you started and interested in your
journey to continue learning about Vim.
